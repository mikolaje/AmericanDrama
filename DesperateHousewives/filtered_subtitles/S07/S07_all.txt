Previously on...
Ten years ago, Carlos' mother
died after being hit by a car
that Andrew was driving.
Orson packed his bags...
You are not the woman
I thought you were.
He's my son. I had no choice.
And I no longer choose
to be your husband.
And Bree decided to come clean.
There's something I
need to tell you...
It's the kind of thing that
could end our friendship.
A dying nurse made a confession...
The people who run this hospital
need to know what I did.
How do you tell parents the
child they've been raising
isn't really theirs?
Financial worries drove
Susan to a big decision...
You can't sell your house.
We're not selling. We're renting.
Which led to the return
of a long-lost neighbor.
The truth is, I used to live here.
Oh, then I guess everyone will
be surprised to see you again.
They absolutely will.
There was a time
when my husband and I
were very happy.
I remember warm summer afternoons
and backyard barbecues
and laughter with friends.
Our life was like some
kind of suburban dream.
But the day comes when
we all must wake up.
For me, that day came
when a letter arrived.
As threats go,
it was concise and to the point.
I did what I had to
to protect my family.
My husband found out
who wrote the letter.
He let her know how
much this upset him.
Her sister figured out
what my husband had done.
So she decided to frame
him for murder...
Her murder, to be more specific.
And that's when the dream
that was Paul Young's life
became a nightmare.
Years later,
a woman was pulled
over for speeding.
This woman had no identification,
so she was arrested.
And that is how people
learned that Felicia tillman
was very much alive.
I see you got the suit I
sent over. You like it?
I like anything that's not orange.
Well, get ready to do
all sorts of shopping.
Your settlement check came in.
So where you going first?
After all these years in prison,
I bet you're ready to party.
All I want is to go home.
What, to your old neighborhood?
You sound surprised.
Well, none of your neighbors
supported you during the trial.
They didn't visit
while you were here.
No one would blame you if
you hated them a little.
Oh, I don't hate them...
A little.
And so my husband
returned to Wisteria Lane.
The neighbors were
surprised to see him.
They hadn't thought about
Paul Young in years.
But he had thought about them.
And he was going to make sure
they'd never forget him... again.
The phone call that comes in
the middle of the night...
The letter that arrives
by special courier...
The e-mail marked "urgent!"...
Yes, there are all sorts of ways
bad news can be delivered.
But some news is so bad...
It must be delivered in person.
Why do I have to tell them?
You said this couple lives
in your neighborhood.
Trustees of the hospital
feel that makes you
uniquely qualified.
And just what am I
supposed to say?
"Great block party.
"By the way, one of our nurses
may have switched your baby
at birth. Try the dip."
Every mite we wait,
this hospital takes
on more liability.
Now get on over to...
Wisteria Lane
and tell those people
what's going on.
I don't know how
I'm gonna do this.
There's only one way to
der news like this...
Remain as calm as possible.
Bree! Get out here!
Damn it! Why is nobody home?
Lorna, Gwen... Oh, thank God.
Well, hi, Karen. What's wrong?
Paul Young... he's back.
What?
You heard me.
Now don't just stand there.
We gotta warn people. Come on.
Bree, I've never
seen you like this.
Are you all right?
I have something
horrible to tell you,
and I don't know how to say it.
Well, you better
think of somethin'.
You're starting to freak me out.
Remember that night
when Carlos' mother
was run over by a car?
Well, I know who did it.
You what?
It was Andrew.
Oh, God!
He was only 16. I was afraid
he was gonna go to jail...
Ohh! So Rex and I
decided to cover it up.
Oh, this is... this is bad.
This is really bad.
I need to go throw up a little.
Oh, I am so sorry. And I realize
I should have told you sooner.
No! No, no, no, you shouldn't
have told me at all!
What? Now I have to tell Carlos,
and he's going to kill Andrew,
and then he's going to
have to go to prison,
so thank you for sending
my husband to prison, Bree.
Nice work!  just couldn't live
with the secret any longer,
and when Orson found out,
he told me I was a horrible person.
That's why you told me?
Oh, please,
we're all horrible people!
You see this? t's yours.
They delivered it here.
I kept it. Horrible!
Just so you know,
Orson was so disgusted,
he's divorcing me.
Normally, I'd give you a hug,
but right now I sorta don't give a crap!
Again very sorry.
God! How am I gonna tell Carlos?
He is gonna be so angry!
And he'll probably
find a way to blame me!
You'll never guess who's back!
Mom, we don't have
any clean plates.
Didn't you run the dishwasher?
We're also out of milk.
You gotta go to the store.
And the dry cleaners
while you're at it.
Okay, everybody.
Look at your hands.
Come on. Mm-hmm.
Anyone not holding a baby,
you're on your own.
You can wash and shop and
clean for yourselves.
My days of being the
perfect mom are over.
When were those days, exactly?
It's my uterus that's worn out,
not my hearing.
So you're not gonna
help with anything?
'Cause this place is really starting
to go to hell. Baby number five.
An entire basketball
team has come out of me,
so I'm officially too
exhausted to care.
You know, the good moms enjoy
doing stuff for their families.
Hello?
That's your brother Preston.
He's about to be beaten.
Yes, he is. Yes, he is.
Mom, it's Renee Perry.
Hey, Renee!
Who's Renee Perry? Oh,
she's your mom's friend from college.
She's married to Doug Perry,
who plays for the Yankees.
And she's really rich. How rich?
Every few years,
Renee flies mom to New York
for a big, fancy weekend.
And mom always comes back in a great mood.
So this might be perfect timing.
Damn it to hell.
She's coming here.
Wh-when?
Tomorrow.
Why?
I don't know,
but that is something
we can talk about
okay, people, move,
move, move. Let's go!
Come on. Hey, you, too, Tom.
I'm holding the baby.
Well, spray her with
some glass cleaner
and rub her on the windows.
I don't want Renee to
know I live like this.
But, mom, if she's your friend,
won't she like you no matter how you live?
She's not that kind of friend.
You're never gonna
believe who's back.
Here we are.
Home sweet...
Home.
So... what do you think, buddy?
This is where we're gonna live?
Yeah.
So are we poor?
If you field this one,
I'll tell him where
babies come from.
No, honey, we're not poor.
We're just...
Lower middle class.
Poor people wish they
could live like this.
They shouldn't.
Oh, sweetie.
I know this isn't
what we're used to.
Buddy, we're not gonna lie to you.
Money is a little
tighter than before,
but that's why we're here...
So we can save up and
get back to our house.
And it's not gonna take that long.
Your daddy's taking on extra jobs,
and I'm still teaching,
and I'm gonna start selling
that really cool jewelry
I've been making.
Oh,
sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
And as long as we're together,
we can survive this.
Hello? Susan!
Hi, Mrs. McCluskey. What's up?
You'll never believe this.
Paul Young is back. What?
Where is he?
Where do you think?
He's in the house you rented to him.
I didn't know.
Lee just told me it was a guy.
You didn't even ask for his name?
He paid in advance, and he
didn't have pets. I didn't care.
How is Paul even out of jail?
That maniac was serving
a life sentence.
Hello, ladies.
If you'd like to
come in for a while,
I'll tell you the story.
Come on now.
It's a good one.
Felicia Tillmas alive?
Why are you so surprised?
I said that over and
over again in my trial.
Oh, wait. That's right.
None of you could make
it to the courthouse.
Look, Paul...
It's okay. You were busy.
I get it.
I told myself I'd
explain how I was framed
when you came to
visit me in prison.
We're so sorry.
In our defense, we thought you
were a cold-blooded killer.
What you endured over
the last ten years...
I can't even imagine it.
No, you can't.
But the good news is, I'm back.
Yeah, about that, um,
why did you wanna come back here?
Well, why do you think?
I missed my friends.
Innocent or not, that guy
still gives me the creeps.
I can't believe Paul Young
is back on Wisteria Lane.
And he's using my shower.
Jack!
You here for your 9 iron? Damn,
I thought if I shaved,
you'd wouldn't recognize
me and I could keep it.
Actually, I need to talk
to you and your wife.
Hey, Gaby!
In a minute!
You look a little pa, buddy.
Something wrong?
I think we should wait for Gaby.
Jack, what's going on here, man?
You're making me nervous.
Let's just go inside, hmm?
No! This is impossible.
We still have the bracelet
they put around Juanita's ankle
in the hospital.
Theresa Pruitt was the nurse
in charge of those bracelets,
and although the hospital did
not know this at the time,
she had a drinking problem.
And eight years later,
you're telling me this.
I've spent eight years loving
someone else's daughter!
Again, I wanna stress
that the hospital
only belatedly became...
Jack, I swear to God,
if you go lawyer on me,
I will put your
head through a wall!
So where is our...
Biologi... God, I don't
even know what to call her.
We haven't been able to
track the family down yet.
Then we're not telling Gaby,
not till you find this other girl.
Carlos, I have a legal
responsibility here.
She has to be told.
Fine! 'll do it.
But I don't know how.
This is going to destroy her.
Nope. I was wrong.
Preston, switch back with Parker.
Why are we doing this?
When Renee pulls up to this house,
she is gonna see the one
thing I can show off...
My beautiful, beautiful family.
What is that,
a pimple? Get in the back!
Honey, don't you think you're
getting a little carried away?
Tom, that woman lives
in a penthouse.
We had to give up meat
so we could buy a laptop.
Let me have this. Is that her?
Of course it is.
Okay, everybody, smile for mom
and her strange and
twisted friendship.
Oh! Hi!
I'm back, Rudolfo.
Please tell signor Cipriani
I always stay in that suite
when I visit Venice,
and if it's not available,
I'll be very unhappy.
Now if you'll excuse me,
there's someone more important
I need to speak with.
Hi!
Hey, Jose.
Thanks for holding.
Look, I can't do Thursday.
So...
Jose, she'll call you back.
Lynette, you haven't changed.
Neither have you.
Hi, sweetie.
Oh, no, please tell me
you didn't dump Tom for this handsome,
young trophy husband.
It's me, Renee.
I mean, I do work out,
like, three times a week,
so maybe that's what you're...
Oh, okay.
Are these your kids? Yeah.
Yes, and here
is our latest addition.
Oh, she's precious.
Look at you all... What a
perfect little suburban picture.
Well, you know, I've been blessed.
Very blessed.
I'm sorry I gotta run, Renee,
but I'm late for work.
Work? And I thought you wore
that sexy tie just for me.
You like it?
They... they say that bolder
colors are coming back,
so I thought I'd... Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Love you.
Oh, I gotta say, Lynette,
this place is adorable.
It's so... cozy and
intimate and...
Pay attention, kids.
You're learning a lot of
new words for "small."
Oh, that's not what I meant.
I hate banging around my
lonely old barn of a house.
Sometimes weeks go by without
me running into a servant.
I'm sure you see
them on whipping day.
Lynette, why so mean?
I worked on these compliments
all the way from the airport.
Drive slower next time.
Mom.
It's all right. We're just
old friends reconnecting.
And I'm being sincere.
This is the way to go...
Stripped down to the
bare essentials.
You know, more people
should live like this.
Most people do live like this.
When you're flying
in your private jet,
and you look down and go, "wow,
they look like ants down there,"
we're the ants.
So you have a private jet?
Well, it's not just ours.
We share it with the team.
Wait. So you get to hang
out with the Yankees?
That's awesome.
How is Doug, by the way?
Oh, he's fine,
but all that stuff...
The team, the jet, the money...
It's like a fantasy world.
This is what I yearn for.
This is real.
This is... Sticky.
So you're staying in
a really fancy hotel?
Well, I came straight
from the airport,
so I haven't booked a hotel yet.
Oh, why don't you stay with us?
Oh, I'm sure Renee
wouldn't want...
I would love to.
Are you sure?
'Cause, you know,
five kids... It gets stickier.
Oh, I don't mind.
It'd be fun.
I've got a lot of catching up
to do with my old, old friend.
By the way, I have a
doctor who can get rid
of one of those "olds."
All right. Well,
I guess I can set you up
on the sleeper sofa.
Sleeper sofa? Ooh. Look at me.
I'm one of the ants.
Hi. You own the building, right?
I'm Susan Delfino.
My husband Mike and I are in 1b.
Jiggle the handle.
The toilet's fine.
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just dropping off
the security deposit.
Sorry it's late. We've been
having some money problems.
Have you?
Well, I'm Maxine.
Come on in.
I'll make you some tea.
Thanks. Come on.
That is such a shame
about Mike's business.
And here you are, with no skills,
trying to make ends meet.
Mm. Oh, I have skills.
I make my own jewelry.
I made this.
Can you believe it?
I really can.
You know, I remember when my
husband Sidney passed away.
His illness took
every dime we had.
And I didn't know
what I was gonna do.
Well, it looks like you did okay.
I mean, you own the building.
Yeah, well, that's because
I stopped pouting.
I got off my tuchis,
and I started my own business.
And now I'm able to help
other struggling women.
You know, they set
their own hours.
They work from their own homes.
And oh, yoy, yoy, the money.
That sounds like a dream job.
I'll bet you'd be real good at it.
Let me show you.
Are there phones involved?
I've been told I have an
excellent phone voice.
Uh, "hello. Can I
interest you in a..."
Oh, my God.
It's my web site!
Va-va-va-broom. Com.
I got a 10-unit Mac
pro server farm
and a 1.5-Meg t1 line.
You run a porn site?
You're trying to lure
me into pornography?
Oh, my God! Did you slip
something into my tea?
Honey, relax.
This is strictly P.G...
Women doing housework in lingerie,
no nudity, no sex.
So?
What do you say?
What do I say?
I say... shame!
Shame on you!
These are nice, respectable girls
just like you.
Deirdre's going to night
school to become a nurse,
and Martha's trying to
start over after a divorce.
Don't they worry about
people they know seeing them?
Most of our clients
are overseas...
You know, Europe, Asia.
So if you go to Kuala Lumpur,
wear a hat.
Come on.
You said you had money problems.
Here's what Martha
makes in a week.
Unto Martha for
selling her dignity
to the highest bidder.
I promise, you won't do anything
I wouldn't let my own daughter do!
Look for yourself!
She's on camera three!
What are you looking at?
Just some family photos.
That's you the day you were born.
Daddy? Who's that?
That's your grandma.
I wish I had met her.
You would've loved her.
Do you think about her a lot?
Every day.
She was the light of my life,
and that's why we
named you after her,
because I could not
imagine a world
without a Juanita Solis in it.
Do you want me to tuck her in?
No, I'll do it. Come on.
Amy and I want to go
to the mall tomorrow.
Oh, sorry, hon. I have plans.
I could ride my bike.
By yourself?  don't think so.
Why not?
You're too young. That's why not.
You're mean.
Well, sometimes I have to be mean
'cause it's my job to protect you.
What if you got hit by a bus?
That's not gonna happen.
Well, I can't take that chance.
You are my whole world.
If something happened to you,
it would ruin my life.
You understand that?
That's the last of it.
I'll put these books in the car.
Pleasure meeting you, Bree.
Nice of your physical therapist
to help with the move.
So are you gonna be okay?
Let's see. Uh,
I'm getting a divorce.
I lost my business,
and I'm sitting here
trying to remember
why I quit drinking.
I've had better Mondays.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
It's for the best.
We haven't been happy
for a long time.
You know what you need?
A project.
No. That's what I always do...
Distract myself with
meaningless busywork
as a way of avoiding my...
emotions.
I think I need to sit quietly
and think about what I'm
gonna do with my life.
Well, whatever you do...
I know it'll be spectacular.
Good-bye, Bree.
Hi, Bree.
I've been thinking about our
conversation last night.
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.
I'm fine.
In fact, I took your advice.
I found myself a project.
I'm surprised you
agreed to see me.
I wanted to spit in your face.
I didn't realize there'd be glass.
That's right. You're not used to prison.
Give yourself time.
What is it now...
two to five years?
18 months with good behavior.
You're giving me a lot of reasons
to be extremely well behaved.
Maybe I can give you a few
pointers on prison life.
I've become a bit of an expert
thanks to you. Hey, here's one.
It never hurts to tip the
guard does your cavity search.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.
I don't care what I have to do.
I will see you behind
bars again, or dead...
Whichever is easier.
Here's another pointer.
They always record
the conversations,
so be careful about threatening
the man you framed.
You murdered my sister.
That's a crazy,
groundless accusation.
I have to go now.
I have things to do like shopping
and walking around in the open air
without a care in the world.
You know you did it.
I did.
Wow, they're all so... big.
Exactly. Thank you.
You're welcome? Oh,
I knew you guys would get it,
unlike those idiots that walked
by my card table in the park.
It's not jewelry.
It's wearable art.
So... who wants to
try these earrings?
Oh, uh, I'm not sure
that my delicate ears
can support something so large.
How about Gaby?
She has big, strong, latin ***.
Lynette, where is
this friend of yours?
We're all dying to meet her.
Come on.
I need a volunteer. Lynette?
Yes! Yes!
How's it feel?
About as good as it looks,
I'm guessing. I'll take'em.
Yes!
What are you guys getting?
I'm gonna buy this... for Bree
and her strong, protestant neck.
Oh, you guys are the best.
Oh, hey, here she is.
Okay, Susan, Bree, Gaby,
this is my old college
roommate, Renee.
Hi. It is so nice
to finally meet you.
Lynette has talked so much
about her friend from college.
Oh, yes, you know how in school
the pretty girls always
hang out together?
Well, I refused to
go along with that.
Renee comes off a little stuck up
when you first meet her,
which is a real ti-saver.
Sit down!
So, Renee, you have to tell us.
What was Lynette like in college?
Uh, absolutely fearless.
She just kept wearing
those parachute pants,
lesbian rumors be damned.
Yes, Renee was always the
one with the fashion sense.
Before I met her, I'd never
even heard of Gucci or Prada...
Or chlamydia.
Wow, you guys play rough.
No, it's just what we do.
It's fun.
I tease her about being all
botulism from the nose up...
And I tease her about
being all cottage cheese
from the waist down.
So, Renee, we hear that
you're married to Doug Perry?
The baseball player?
No surprise there.
In our sorority, Renee was voted
most likely to marry well.
And Lynette was voted
most likely to succeed.
So, Bree, I hear
you're an amazing cook.
Hang on a second. What was that?
What?
That... "Aw."
Oh, nothing.
I just didn't wanna...
make you feel bad.
About what?
Well, it... it's just that, uh,
I think our college
friends would be surprised
to see how you ended up.
Oh, I thought they
were still playing.
You know, Renee, I have had a
career and raised a family.
And that's great.
It's just that we had
such high hopes for you.
Sponging off a rich guy.
Hey, let's stop before somebody gets hurt.
Whatever I got, I got on my own.
And what have you got?
A blouse from the
"I've stopped trying" collection
and a pair of earrings
your kid made at camp?
And... somebody got hurt.
That's great. Easy shots.
You got more money than me.
Oh, it's not about the money.
The Lynette I knew never
would have settled for this.
You were adventurous.
You backpacked through Croatia.
You jumped onstage at
a Springsteen concert.
It's just hard for me to reconcile
this suburban housewife
with the girl...
Who had a threesome with two of
the guys from the rugby team.
Why would she do this?
Why would she jump
in a private jet
and fly all the way
across the country
just to dump on my life?
Two guys, huh? We're not
talking about that anymore.
I mean, isn't her
life perfect enough?
Does she really need
to score bonus points
by taking me down?
So was it one rugby guy
and then the other,
or just sort of a-a scrum?
Oh, drop it, Tom.
You know, I have shielded you
from some of the Wilder
things that I've done,
like that time at the
amusement park...
Little story I like to call
"'d' cups on the teacups."
Okay, I'm dropping it now.
Thank you.
Why are you getting so upset?
I mean, I thought you and Renee
loved to zing each other.
Those weren't zings.
When she made that... "Aw,"
she meant it. I mean,
what the hell was that?
She doesn't get to be
disappointed in my life.
Well, maybe you should
tell her how you feel.
Yeah. You're right. You're right.
In fact, I am going to tell
her a lot more than that.
Good for you.
But when you get back,
I'd like to revisit a
certain request I made
on my 40th birthday, which,
in light of recent revelations,
seems a lot more...
Okay.
What's this?
Yellow pages.
Hotel is under "h."
Yeah, I had a feeling I hit
a nerve this afternoon.
If you find my life that pathetic,
I'm going to spare you the
agony of observing it.
And by the way, taxi is under "t."
Lynette, I don't think
your life is pathetic.
Maybe not, but you clearly think
yours is a whole lot better.
So if you need me to say it,
I'll say it. You win.
You got the fabulous clothes,
the penthouse apartment,
and the rich husband.
Congratulations.
Doug is leaving me.
I found out he was cheating...
With his agent's assistant.
I confronted him,
told him it was her or me,
and he chose her.
I threw some things
in a bag and took off.
I didn't have a plan.
I just needed to get out of there,
and I couldn't think
of anywhere else to go.
Why didn't you tell me this?
Lynette, my life is
about to fall apart.
I haven't even admitted
it to myself yet.
How could I tell you?
Well, of course you can stay
here as long as you want.
Thanks.
And to show my appreciation,
I would like to pay for
your first face-lift.
That is so generous.
Although now you've had nine,
you probably get
the next one free.
Hey, Carlos. What can I...
I'll make this quick.
I'm gonna give you two options.
Option one... I sue
this hospital for...
I don't know... $10 million,
$20 million,
and I think I'll get it.
That would bankrupt us.
Then you're probably gonna wanna
go for option two. Which is?
You make this whole
thing go away...
Shred the documents, call off
the search for the other family,
and never, ever let Gaby
find out about this.
Carlos, we've sent out letters,
hired investigators.
I don't know if this
process can be stopped.
And even if it could,
this is a hell of a thing
you're taking about,
keeping this secret by yourself.
What's my choice?
If Gaby knew the truth.
No. I can't tell her.
I can't tell him. Are you sure?
Doesn't he deserve to know
what Andrew did to his mother?
You have to understand...
Carlos is so happy right now.
Our marriage is the
best it's ever been.
He loves his job.
The girls are turning
out so beautifully.
Except for this one
easily ignorable blip...
Our life is perfect.
And I won't let
anything change that.
Pork chops for dinner.
I know it was a bit of a splurge,
but I made up for it...
1 Ply toilet paper.
Something wrong?
The bank turned down
my loan application.
Without that money,
I can't hire any help.
And without help,
it's just gonna be one
dinky job after another.
We'll never get outta
here like that.
Okay. Well, we'll scrimp and save.
I won't buy pork chops anymore.
I'm gonna return these.
I'm thinking about
taking a job in Alaska.
What?
A buddy told me about it...
six months on an oil rig.
One year at the most.
I could make triple
what I can earn here.
You can probably move back in
the house before I'm even done.
Mike, that is really
dangerous work.
M.J. Needs you here.
I need you here.
No, there's gotta be another way.
You think I wanna go?
We don't have any
good options here.
Give me a month before
you make a decision.
I've just got a feeling that
this jewelry thing of mine
could start pulling
in some serious money.
Sweetheart, you're talented,
but "serious money"?
You'd be surprised
what some people are
willing to pay for.
No nudity, no sex,
and no one can ever know.
I am so glad I can help.
So what did you remove
this with... a puma?
I was anxious to get rid of it.
My soon-to-be ex-husband
picked out most of the decor,
and I realized I
needed a fresh start.
You know, wallpaper's nice,
but it's a little...
Well, it's your house, not mine.
No, Keith, please. I hired you.
I wanna hear your ideas.
I would suggest that
you paint this room
something, you know, bold.
Oh, I like the sound of that.
Perhaps a nice, deep beige.
Or... bolder.
I mean, with the size of
this room and the light,
you could go...
Scarlet red.
Please don't take
this the wrong way,
but I'm going to be serving
dinner in this room,
not sailors.
Could you excuse me for a moment?
I'll be right back.
Here you go...
The final division of assets.
Just need a Jill Hancock from you,
and we're all set.
Uh, before I forget,
Andrew's having a dinner
party on the 10th,
and he'd love for you to come.
Even though we're separating,
we both want you to feel that
you're still part of the family.
I'm touched. Thank you, Bree.
Orson, don't we have plans?
The wine tasting?
Why don't you wait
for me in the van?
As you may have gleaned,
my relationship with
Judy has... evolved.
Was it evolving while you
and I were still together?
No, no, of course not.
Apparently,
she had feelings for me,
but she waited a
respectable amount of time
before expressing them.
It's been a week.
You know the expression
"the ink's not even dry"?
It's not dry!
We have separated, Bree.
And the two of us spent so
many years being miserable.
I just think at our age,
we can't let an opportunity
for happiness pass us by.
Forget the red.
I've got something here
called moonstruck yellow
that will kick your
dining room's ass.
Come on. I promise.
You'll love this.
With your red hair,
you will look so hot in this room.
But, you know, whatever you want.
Clearly you have other options.
Maybe I do.
There's my favorite realtor.
Thanks for coming over.
How are ya?
Bit of a pariah, thanks to you.
Don't tell me the neighbors
are blaming you for my return.
Of course they are.
You know, when you told me
that you didn't have any pets,
you could have mentioned
it's because they don't allow
them in prison. Now, now, be nice.
I'm about to throw more
business your way. Oh?
I hear that my old house
is back on the market.
I'd like to buy it.
Because of all the
wonderful memories?
Just find out what they're asking.
Okay, but you just signed a
one-year lease on this place,
d you're buying a house
across the street.
Doesn't sound like
a very good plan.
Oh, believe me. I've had ten
years to work on this plan.
It's a good one.
Bad news travels quickly,
and when it arrives, we have
to find a way to deal with it.
If our husbands tell
us they've moved on...
We look for projects
to distract us.
If the bills start to stack up...
We find ways to earn extra cash.
If we're told a secret
too terrible to share...
We learn to keep it to ourselves.
But we must remember the
bad news that's delivered
can sometimes be good news...
In disguise.
That the guy you
were talkin' about?
The one that killed your sister?
It certainly is.
He looks like a killer.
It's a shame they let him out.
As it turns out,
it's all for the best.
Paul can now receive the
punishment he's entitled to.
What do you mean?
Just between us girls,
Paul Young will be
dead within six months.
How you gonna make that happen?
You're in here at least two years.
True, but you see,
Paul Young doesn't have a
friends on that street.
I do.
Previously on...
That maniac was serving
a life sentence.
Hello, ladies.
Paul young came back.
Doug is leaving me.
Lynette's friend had nowhere to go.
I've spent eight years loving
someone else's daughter.
A baby was switched long ago,
and Carlos made a decision.
We're not telling Gaby.
Susan got a job offer.
Women doing housework in lingerie.
While Bree's contractor...
With your red hair,
you will look so hot in this room.
Brought possibilities to light.
All set.
Now that you're a biker chick,
there's one other thing
you gotta know how to do.
Thanks, mister.
It had been a long time
since Bree Van De Kamp
was a little girl,
but she could still remember
everything she'd ever
been told about sex.
Her grandmother informed her
it was a woman's burden.
Her minister warned
her it was a sin.
Her teacher taught
her it was unhealthy.
Yes, everyone had told Bree
her sexual urges were dangerous.
But no one had ever told her...
how to get rid of them.
Hey. There you are.
I'm off to the bank.
Before you go,
I wanna show you something.
Come here. Whole new idea.
I wanna panel the study in this.
Oh. Well, that's, uh, unusual.
Historical birch from
a Wyoming snow fence.
Over 200 years old. Feel it.
No. Really.
Feel it.
You know what they call this?
Witness wood, 'cause it's
seen so much history,
unlike me,
who slept through history
and had to go to summer school.
I have to go. It's late.
Yes, when Bree was a little girl,
she'd been taught
her sexual urges were dangerous.
Unfortunately,
she was about to learn...
Those urges were dangerous...
For everyone.
Juanita. Oh, hey. Oh.
Sync by YYeTs.net
The doctors and nurses
at Fairview Hospital
are experts at healing.
They can set bones...
Bandage wounds...
And treat diseases.
Sadly, one thing they
don't know how to heal
is a guilty conscience.
I don't know what happened.
She just came out of nowhere.
Oh, honey, this
could've been any of us.
Kids on that street are always
playing where they shouldn't be.
Still, I would just feel
better if they would come out
and tell us something.
Juanita was talking when they
put her in the ambulance,
so I'm sure everything's
gonna be fine.
And I just spoke to
one of the nurses.
She seemed pretty positive.
Well, that's a relief.
Paul?
W-what are you doing here?
I heard about the accident,
so I-I rushed right over.
That's what neighbors do, right?
Well, that's very thoughtful.
We'll tell Gaby you stopped by.
Yeah, don't feel like
you have to hang around.
There's nothing we can do.
We can pray.
Dear lord, we ask that you
be with this young child
and with the doctors
caring for her...
And that she may be
returned in full health
to loving family. Amen.
Amen.
Well, I have to get home.
I'm expecting someone.
Please extend my
good wishes to Gaby.
Dear lord, please don't let
that creep ever touch me again.
Amen.
Oh, Gaby, thank God.
How is Juanita?
She's gonna be fine.
They're keeping her a couple
days for observation. Oh.
So I told Carlos he doesn't
even have to fly back
from his business trip.
That's great news.
Yeah, it is.
Uh, Bree, Andrew,
can I talk to you for a second?
Thanks for coming.
I feel so blessed to
have such wonderful...
What the hell is wrong
with you people?!
First you take out
my mother-in-law,
then you go after my daughter.
Are you trying to kill off every
Juanita Solis on the planet?!
I admit it was a
terrible coincidence.
You're gettin' sloppy, you know.
This one was in broad
daylight. I'm sorry.
She just came out of nowhere.
Have you seen my daughter?
She never comes out of nowhere.
Uh, on a related note,
I just wanna say how much I appreciate
you not telling Carlos about
me running over his mom.
I'm gonna give you that one
'cause I wasn't fond of her.
But as for the rest of my family,
learn to swerve!
Why does this keep happening?
I don't know. I mean,
maybe God's punishing us.
Or God is punishing the Solises,
and we're just doing God's work.
I feel awful.
I should never have been
fiddling with that radio.
Radio? Mom, I saw you
from across the street.
You were checking out Keith's ass.
That's preposterous.
You were looking at
that contractor's butt
like you were waiting for
a side of steak sauce.
Watch your mouth. This isn't one
of your homosexual dance clubs.
I'm telling you, it was the radio.
Okay. Fine. But while we're
talking about the radio,
uh, you do know that that
particular model is, like,
15 years too young for you, right?
Who is it?
Maxine.
Oh!
Oh, uh, hang on a second.
Ah, I was just wrapping
up my first session.
I know. I was watching.
And?
What'd you think?
It was like watching a dream.
And you know why?
'Cause I was asleep.
Sit down, honey.
It's time I gave
you a few pointers.
Now... you see what
I'm doing here?
Ohh.
And let's not forget the duster.
Okay. Okay, I-I get it.
And what have we here? Smudges.
Uh, we eat off that table.
Am I making my point?
We are selling a fantasy here.
You gotta, you know, loosen up.
I want to. I just...
I can't stop thinking about all
those men out there watching me.
Yes, they're watching you.
They are spending their
hard-earned dollars
to see the perfect woman.
You, my darling,
have all the power here.
Now...
Is that a crumb I see on that rug?
Mm. Oh.
Oh.
That's it.
Ah!
That's my girl. Ooh!
Doug, if your lawyers don't
sweeten the settlement offer,
I will sue you for
half of everything,
and that includes your
girlfriend's new implants.
You paid for 'em out
of our joint account,
so technically,
one of those puppies is mine.
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe throw it in the pool
and use it as a floatie.
Uh, Renee.
Oh, she's gonna be
dating soon enough.
It's time she learned
what men are all about.
Now, sweetie,
what did auntie Renee
teach you about marriage?
Never sign a prenup.
Oh! Jeez!
Hey!
What are you doing home from work?
I'm not feeling well.
Again? Yeah.
That's the third time this week.
You need to go to the doctor.
No, I'm fine.
I'm just gonna lie on the
couch and watch some TV.
Okay.
Oh!
Before you fire up
the golf channel,
you think maybe you
could make a quick run
to the grocery store? I'm tired.
Can't you do it?
I'm a little busy right now.
I've got five kids and
a useless houseguest.
Hi there.
I need you functional.
Either go to the doctor
and get some help
or quit complaining
and give me some help.
Fine. I'll go tomorrow.
Man, the sympathy in here
is just overwhelming.
What?
Nothing. It's none of my business.
But...
You may wanna be careful.
You two are starting to sound
a lot like me and Doug.
I appreciate the concern,
but Tom and I always do that.
Doug and I always did that, too.
Look at us now.
I'm telling you, we're fin
if you say so.
Good.
The doctors say
she's gonna be fine.
They're only keeping her in
the hospital as a precaution.
She'll be home in a few days.
Oh, thank God.
Can we please not have
another ugly scene?
I only came to check
on Juanita. She's fine.
Fantastic.
So I see you let our
tomato plants whither...
Just like you did
our relationship.
Well, that's what happens when
you grow needy, whiny tomatoes.
Boys, boys, it's been a month.
Can't you just kiss each
other's bottoms and make up?
Isn't that what they do?
Who is that?
She looks lost.
Should we help her?
Aah! Son of a bitch!
We should help her. Son of a...
Oh! Oh!
Miss, is everything okay?
No.
I am so lost.
I gave the cab driver the address,
but I only had a $20,
and it turns out
that only gets you as
far as hibiscus circle,
so he dumped me,
and I had to walk in
these shoes, which broke,
and that is the last
time I am buying footwear
over the Internet. Uh,
were you looking for Wisteria Lane?
Yeah, that sounds right.
Is my fish moving?
If he goes belly-up,
this is going to be the worst day ever.
Who is it you're here to see?
Uh, Paul young.
Really? A-are you a friend of his?
W-well...
Beth!
Oh! I thought you were
gonna be here hours ago.
Well... I see you've
all met my wife.
Sorry, it got...
Really hot in here,
and I thought you'd
be gone for a while.
So how is Juanita? Is she okay?
Um, she's doing much better.
Thank you for asking.
Thank God. How are you doing?
Um, me? I'm okay.
How's the work coming?
Pretty good.
Just getting ready to put, uh...
Shoot. It's on backwards.
Bree?
You sure you're okay?
I'm fine. Fine.
It's just been a very...
Stressful day.
I think I know what you need.
It's okay.
Hitting that little
girl was an accident.
It could've happened to anyone.
I have to let you go!
Huh?
After you let me go.
Everyone should just let go!
Are you firing me?
Why?
You're too messy.
Your tools... they're
scattered everywhere.
Well, this is a construction site.
And you're getting paint
all over the place.
And that cologne of yours-
it's overpowering.
I don't wear cologne.
That's just you?
Oh, dear.
Anyway, obviously...
I will pay you for the
time you've put in,
but I think you should go.
You can... send me a check.
Bye, guys.
Have a great day.
Hey, aren't you going to work?
Oh, my first class
isn't till 11:00.
I thought I'd spend the
morning making more jewelry.
Wow, you really are determined
to bring in some extra money.
You have no idea.
And you don't let me put
my feet on that table.
Mike! Uh, what are you...
What are you doing home so quick?
I forgot my thermos.
What are you wearing?
Uh...
Uh, I was, uh,
just... just doing housework...
O-obviously,
and, uh, the air
conditioning isn't working,
so it got really hot in here.
I'll say.
Mind if I join you?
No! No! Uh...
Oh!
Uh... you know what?
Why don't we take
this in the bedroom?
What's wrong with right here?
I am one lucky guy...
To come home to a hot
fantasy like this.
Yep. And I am one lucky girl
to have a...
Have a husband like...
You. Ohh.
Any luck finding an apartment?
Not with my settlement.
With New York prices,
I'll be forced to live in
a place smaller than this.
Oh, my God. How will you keep
from bumping into yourself?
You know what I was thinking?
Why don't I just find a
place here in Fairview?
Fairview?
Uh... no.
No, no!
You're a new yorker.
You love the theater, museums.
You said yourself,
you can't even get a decent
cup of coffee around here.
Uh, no, I meant here, Lynette.
Really, how hard is
it to clean the pot?
Hey! How'd it go with the doctor?
Yeah, can, uh, we, um...
talk about that?
So what did the doctor say?
You're gonna wanna sit down.
Tom, you are scaring me.
What is it?
I have postpartum depression.
Come again?
I know it sounds weird,
b-but it's... it's...
it's a recognized problem
for fathers my age.
I've got all the
classic symptoms...
headaches, mood swings,
fatigue.
Wow.
Tell me, did he check you
for a yeast infection
while he was down there, too?
Why don't you learn the facts
before you make fun of it?
"Men and postpartum:
The bitter seed."
Yeah, I'm... not buying it.
Show me one stretch mark,
one chapped nipple,
and we'll talk about
your postpartum.
It's a legitimate
medical condition.
And you're the one who told
me to go to the doctor.
So you could be of some
use around here,
not so you could, uh...
Oh, "take long baths or
get in some extra naps"?
Do me a favor.
Read the whole pamphlet.
Gosh, I wish I could, Tom.
Unfortunately, I have to go
take care of my other baby.
I love the house.
Oh. Well, I did the best I could.
I think it needs a woman's touch.
Oh.
I-I don't have much
experience with decorating.
If I so much as moved a chair,
mama would throw a fit.
Mm, then you must be happy to
finally have your own home.
I guess.
Look at this...
No plexiglas.
I never dreamed the day would come
when I could reach
out and touch you.
I didn't either.
There is one thing I'll
miss about prison...
your letters.
Some days, they were the
only things keeping me going.
I'm glad you liked them.
Uh, thank you again for
going to so much trouble.
Dinner is wonderful.
I wanted tonight to be special.
Since the prison didn't
allow conjugal visits,
this is... kind of
our wedding night.
About that..
I can't wait to start
cooking for you
and making things
nice around here,
but there are certain other...
Wifely duties that I
don't want to rush into.
Oh?
We're still getting
to know each other.
Mama said you'd understand.
Oh, I suppose I do.
You're not upset?
Of course not.
There's more to marriage than sex.
Oh, Mrs. Solis, can I talk to you?
If this is about Juanita
and the dessert cart,
I told you not to
leave it unattended.
No, I was reviewing her chart,
and I realized we still
had a couple of questions.
Is she allergic to any medications? Uh,
not that I'm aware of.
Okay. All her vaccinations
up-to-date? Yes.
And how old was she
when you adopted her?
I know it's hard to believe
that the little acorn gave
birth to the mighty oak,
but believe me, I did.
Okay.
Maybe I'm confused,
but the other day
when we talked about
possible blood transfusions,
you told me you and your
husband were type-o.
Yeah, we are.
So?
W-well, your daughter is type-a.
Two 0's can't have an "a."
Oh.
Never mind.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What... what was that?
What was that "oh. Never mind"?
It's none of my business.
No, no, tell me.
What are you implying?
Nothing.
I'm simply stating that the
odds of Mr. Solis being
the biological father
of a type-a baby
are roughly... nil.
Are you suggesting
I cheated on him?
I'm simply stating that the
odds of Mr. Solis being
the biological father are-
Listen, nursie.
I know you spend your
days emptying bedpans
and shaving the groins
of senior citizens,
but there's no drama here.
I've been faithful to my husband.
I have nothing to hide.
Give me that.
Ah.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Did you have trouble sleeping?
Ah, I was up kinda late.
Boy, that Tom sure can talk.
You were up with Tom?
Huh? Oh. Yeah. I guess
he had a lot on his mind.
No surprise after the way things
went between you two yesterday.
He was complaining about that?
Oh, I don't want to
get in the middle.
Honey, you had a pajama
party with my husband
at 3:00 in the morning.
You're in the middle.
Well...
Tom feels that you
don't listen to him.
Okay. G... Sure I do.
I heard that whole spiel
about male postpartum,
otherwise known by
its initials... B.S.
See, that's just the thing.
He thinks you hear,
but you don't listen.
Okay.
Okay, you stop.
I don't need you
troubleshooting my marriage.
And I don't want
you having any more
of these little conversations
with my husband.
Okay. Fine.
And I mean it.
There you are!
I called you an hour ago!
I was at school.
Hi, sweetie! The kids in
your class made you a poster.
Look what Brittany said. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She loves it. Come on!
Come on!
Oh! What is going on?!
Okay.
Do you remember eight years ago
when we went on that ski weekend?
Uh... vaguely.
No, no, no, no,
no! It can't be "vaguely."
I need you to focus. Oh! Oh! Okay.
Okay.
Remember how you and I had
dinner with that French guy?
The one you referred
to as le package?
Exactly.
Okay. Tell me
everything you remember.
Ooh! I remember I had the
fondue and I lost my strawberry,
and the waiter almost
caught me when I put my...
I'm talking about
me and the package!
Why are you yelling at me?
'Cause I'm mad! You went off to bed
and left me and frenchie
drinking at the hotel bar,
and friends don't let
friends flirt drunk!
Now for the love of God,
do you at least remember
when I came back to the room?
I remember the sun was coming up.
Oh, God.
Gaby, you're not saying...
Yeah.
I think Juanita might be French.
When Carlos returned
from his business trip.
He stopped at the hospital
to visit his daughter,
who had been sleeping peacefully.
Then he came home to see his wife,
who had been plotting frantically.
Oh, you're awake.
Mmm. You're really awake.
What...
Carlos, what are you doing?!
Me? I just got into bed!
You climbed on top of me.
I did? Yeah.
You were kinda making out with me.
Not that I'm complaining.
Oh, no. It's happening again!
What are you talking about?
My sexsomnia.
Your what?
Yeah, it's like sleepwalking,
except...
Instead of using your legs,
you use your... you know.
Sexsomnia.
It's real. Look it up.
Since when have you had that?
Well, definitely before
the girls were born.
I've never seen you do it before.
Well, it mostly only happens
when I'm really tired,
like when I work out too much
or go skiing.
Well, then first thing tomorrow,
I'm checking out airfare to Aspen.
No! No, no, no. It's not a joke.
It's dangerous.
It doesn't matter who I'm next to.
I could have sex and
not even know it.
Wow.
Well, since you're up...
No, I'm too tired...
And ashamed. Good night.
Hey, I thought I'd return this.
I borrowed it from Orson a
while back. Oh. Thank you.
So where's that chippendale dancer
you hired to fix your house?
If you mean my contractor,
his name is Keith,
and I had to let him go.
Why? You catch him, uh,
grating cheese on his abs?
It just wasn't working out.
Must've been pretty bad for you
to kick that shirtless wonder
out of your front yard.
I was finally reaching my
target heart rate on my walk.
You mean at your age,
you still have urges to...
I'm not dead, Bree.
I may like my bed
and my food soft,
but I like my men... okay.
Okay. Just curious.
I guess I was hoping...
Hoping to?
That one day I might
outgrow all this.
Ah, that's why you fired Keith.
I just can't have him around.
He's too distracting.
And I refuse to make
a fool of myself.
And how would that happen?
Well, let me run the
numbers for you.
My marriage ended six days ago,
Keith is 15 years
too young for me,
and my track record with lovers...
two dead, one in a wheelchair.
Bree, I can't tell you
how to live your life.
All I know is that not living
your life isn't the answer.
I've just... never been
very good at taking risks.
Well, then get good,
because take my word for it,
once they turn into regrets,
it's too late.
Okay.
Hi.
Don't feel like you have
to help or anything.
Cool.
Oh.
Where's your dad? His car's gone.
Uh, he and Renee
went out to dinner.
He and Renee?
Yeah. They went to that
French restaurant dad likes.
They said you could
join them if you want.
Oh, I want.
Okay, you unload these groceries
and look after your sister.
Nah, I've got plans tonight.
I don't want to get
stuck babysitting.
Cool.
Hey.
Hey. Good, you got the message.
Loud and clear.
So you guys sure look like
you're discussing something heavy.
Ahem. What's up?
To be honest,
I was talking about you...
And your tendency to be critical,
and how frustrating it is to
have my feelings invalidated
whenever I bring up
something you don't like.
Uh-huh.
Renee, sidebar.
Did I or did I not tell you
to butt the hell
out of my marriage?
What did I do?
I was just finishing my dessert
and listening to the guy talk.
"How frustrating it is to
have my feelings invalidated"?
That's got your $500-an-hour
shrink written all over it.
I was just trying to help.
That's a load of crap.
You need a project,
and since you're currently without
a house to remodel, you've decided
to put the wrecking
ball to my marriage.
Oh, please. This is what you do.
You take other people's lives
apart for your own amusement,
and then you get the fun of
putting them back together.
Well, I'm not letting
you do it this time.
My marriage is not
some guest bathroom
in your summer house.
Fine. Let's just say
that you're right,
and I'm a terrible person.
But there's still a man
in there who is in pain,
and his wife won't listen to him.
That's not my doing.
I think this sidebar is over.
Hey, Susan?
Hey.
Oh, those are beautiful.
What's the occasion?
I called the bank
to see if they would give us an
extension on our car payment,
and the guy told me
you already paid it.
Had a good week with my jewelry.
You're amazing.
You teach,
you bust your ass with
this jewelry business,
and I come home yesterday,
and here you are,
as happy as can be,
working to make this place a home.
I'm so lucky to have
a wife like you.
Mmm.
Wow.
There ya go.
That's quite a haul.
You know, you're
gettin' good as this.
I didn't think that
was gonna happen.
I'm also getting good
at lying to my husband.
I didn't think that was
gonna happen either.
Hello, Keith.
How'd you find me?
You follow the scent of
my nonexistent cologne?
No. Your answering service
said I might find you here.
I was a little out of
sorts the other day,
and... Uh, well, long story short,
I was hoping you'd
consider coming back.
I've got a buddy,
loves sports cars.
I told him to buy an
old Pontiac G.T.O.
They run great,
they're easy to work on.
But he bought a Maserati.
The thing is always in the shop,
very temperamental,
real pain in the ass.
You seem like kind
of a Maserati to me.
I'm no Maserati, Keith.
I'm a family sedan
with a beige interior
who's going through a divorce.
Well, I'm sorry about that,
but I'm still gonna pass.
I-I need you.
You've seen my house.
It's kind of a mess.
And the truth is,
my life's kind of a mess, too.
And when you came in
with all your energy and
your wonderful ideas,
I started feeling like
maybe you were gonna help me
put it all back together...
My house, not my life.
I just want you to
work on the house.
Wow.
I really do sound like a Maserati.
Um...
Thanks for listening.
Hey!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Are you all right?
I didn't see you there.
You've got great legs.
You ever consider just
jogging from place to place?
What were you doing behind my car?
I thought about what you said.
It'd be a shame if we didn't
finish what we started.
Are you sure? It's a big job,
and the boss is kinda nutty.
I love a challenge.
Now can I get your
insurance information?
So...
How are you doing?
What's this? Genuine concern?
No asking if my
breasts feel swollen
or if it's a heavy flow day?
I know I was dismissive before,
and I want to apologize.
I read the pamphlet,
and it actually made sense.
Becoming a new dad at your
age can be pretty scary.
I mean, just looking
at that little girl
and knowing you might not
be around for her wedding...
Is this supposed to be helping me?
I'm saying it's real,
and I get it.
And now in order
to demonstrate that
I am a loving and caring wife,
I have two options.
One, we can have a long,
sensitive conversation
about your feelings,
or option two...
Mmm.
As much I like option two,
I think tonight...
I wanna talk.
Oh.
You got it.
What... what's that?
I got you a little something.
Oh.
Try it on.
Paul...
This isn't... really my style.
Let me be the judge of that.
We talked about this.
You said we could take it slow.
It's been almost a week.
Isn't that slow enough?
Try it. Maybe it'll
put you in the mood.
It won't. Come on.
Paul, no.
How could you possibly think I
would wear something like this?
What are those?
The letters you sent me in prison.
Oh.
Read this.
Paul, please don't get upset...
out loud.
"I long for you to kiss my neck,
to whisper in my ear while
you unbutton my blouse."
Go on.
"Make love to me...
All night long."
Did you write these?
It was a fantasy.
I never thought it would be real.
It is real.
Paul, please... We're married now.
What did you expect?
I thought you would
stay in prison.
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.
It's not a surprise to me
that you have some issues.
I mean, you married a man
in prison for murder.
Clearly, you are a
disturbed young woman.
The good news is,
I'm willing to help you.
All I ask in return is
for a little affection.
Do you think you
can offer me that?
I'll try.
Good.
I'm a patient man, Beth.
But just so we're clear,
I won't be patient forever.
Don't worry. I cleaned the pot.
The way things have
been going lately,
I'm not as worried about
taste as I am poison.
Look, what you did
was borderline evil.
But you were right to
make me talk to Tom,
so I thank you for
being a good friend,
and don't ever do it again.
You're welcome.
You know, when I don't
feel like killing you,
I think I like having you around.
Good to know since I just rented
the most charming bungalow
right here on Wisteria Lane.
You're kidding.
Edie's old house?
Wow, that is so...
Wonderful?
Close.
Um, I-I'm trying to calm the baby,
but apparently I don't
have the right equipment.
Did you hear the big news?
Renee is moving in just just
a stone's throw away from us.
You do know that's just
an expression, right?
We'll see.
Do you really think
it's a good idea
for you to move here?
Of course. It'll be a nice,
fresh start.
Plus I can be close
to my dear friend.
It's just, um...
I wanna be sure... Tom,
that was a million years ago.
It doesn't matter. She can never
know what happened between us.
Have you seen my wife?
Yeah, she's in the cafeteria.
Oh, while I've got you,
could I have you sign
these release forms?
Then you'll be able
to take Juanita home.
What's this torn
page on her chart?
Let's just say your wife
has a bit of a temper.
What happened?
Well, it's not really my place,
but she did have a strong reaction
when I told her your
daughter's blood type.
Gaby did this?
I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.
Oh, crap.
Gaby, come back here!
It's not my fault!
I have a disorder!
Gaby, we have to talk!
Damn it! Aah!
Gaby!
See you in about two seconds.
Okay, here's what happened.
It was on that ski
weekend eight years ago.
I don't normally
go for French guys,
but you know how I get when I
drink too much champagne. What?
Well, I didn't think I slept with him,
but I must have,
because why else would our
daughter have type-a blood?
You're not killing me.
Why aren't you killing me?
Baby, come with me.
There's something I
have to tell you.
There are certain kinds of pain
that can't be treated
in a hospital,
so those who are suffering
do what they can
to heal themselves.
Some cure the ache of loneliness
by making new friends.
Some soothe their
excruciating guilt
with an infusion of cash.
Some alleviate their
burning desire
with small acts of kindness.
But sadly,
there will always be those
who can't begin to heal...
Because they realize
there is more pain
yet to come.

Previously on...
Susan showed a certain
flair for her new job.
There you go. You know,
you're getting good at this.
Renee rented a house.
Wow, that is so... wonderful?
Close.
There's something I
have to tell you.
Gaby learned the truth
about her daughter being
switched at birth.
Beth!
Paul young continued
to surprise everyone.
Well, I see you've
all met my wife.
And Tom came home with a
mysterious affliction.
I'm not feeling well.
Again?
I'm just gonna lie on the
couch and watch some tv.
Tom Scavo was depressed,
and his wife had done
everything she could
to cheer him up.
She had made his favorite meals.
She had told her funniest jokes.
She'd even worn her
sexiest lingerie.
But nothing worked.
Finally, Lynette insisted her
husband go to the doctor.
Unfortunately,
what he came home with
was a prescription... for trouble.
Antianxiety medication?
This is what he gave you?
Dr. Weiler says it will help.
He spent 20 minutes with you.
Lynette... and let me guess.
Did he write this
with a pen that has the drug
company's name on it?
I need this medicine.
Then take it, but I gotta tell ya,
those drugs scare
the crap out of me.
I gotta do something.
I am so tired of feeling this way.
But you've gone through
rough patches before.
You could come out of it.
So wait around to get better?
That's your answer?
You don't know what it's
like inside my head!
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry. Hey! Hey!
Remember when Susan kept
having all those headaches?
Who was that guy that she went to?
Doctor... Dr. Ross.
How is he gonna be any different?
He's holistic.
He tries to stay away from heavy meds.
Susan loved him.
And if he says I
should be on this?
Then you have a second opinion.
Whatever he says, I'll go with it.
Shh. Shh. Shh.
Well...
I saw Dr. Ross.
Oh! I'm so glad.
Did you like him?
Loved him.
And you were right.
He... he doesn't believe
in pharmaceuticals.
He only prescribes stuff that's
totally herbal and natural.
That is fantastic.
So what did he suggest?
Medical marijuana.
Yes,
Tom Scavo had been
battling depression,
but he was now facing
a much bigger battle
with his wife.
Happiness...
it's something we all want,
and so we search for it.
Little girls find it in
the taste of chocolate.
Well-dressed men discover
it at their local mall.
Teenage boys experience it
when talking to a pretty girl.
And then there are housewives,
who simply can't be happy
until they've learned
everything they can
about the newest
neighbor on the block.
Hello!
Hi. So sorry to interrupt.
This will just take a second.
We wanted to officially welcome
you to the neighborhood.
Oh! This is my friend
Lynette and Susan,
and I was telling them
about you, and we...
just had to meet you. Immediately.
That's so sweet.
Oh, you... you're my
landlady, right?
Yes, but I really want you
to think of me as a friend.
Are those pictures hung on
the wall with nails or...
um, we wanted to invite you
to our weekly poker game.
Shoot. I don't know
how to play poker.
Oh, don't worry. We'll teach you.
Does that ficus tree
have a saucer underneath?
Because those are hardwood floors.
And while you're learning
all about Texas Hold'em,
we'll learn all about you.
Aw! That sounds fun.
Okay, well, uh, we should be going.
We'll see you later.
Okay.
Bye. Bye.
What did those women want?
They invited me to
play cards with them.
But they were just being friendly.
On this street,
never confuse being nosy
with being friendly.
They were digging for dirt.
So...
Do you not want me to go?
No, no. You will go.
Give them all sorts of
meaningless information.
And hopefully, they'll start
to think of you as a friend.
But... if you don't like them,
why do you want me to
be friends with them?
In time, it will be useful.
Where's the pen?
Don't you wanna read it first?
Why? Did a nurse get drunk
and swap it with a
different document?
By signing this, Mr. Solis,
you are agreeing
not to bring any legal
action against this hospital.
Do you understand?
And in return, you'll stop
searching for the other family.
Do you understand?
Done. Gaby.
Babe, we talked about this.
We don't know how this
other family will react,
and we need to protect Juanita.
I am sorry, Gabrielle.
I can only imagine
how you must feel.
You can't begin to
imagine how I feel.
The only person who could is
the woman who has my daughter.
If signing can spare
her this pain...
Then I will do it.
I love it!
Somehow I get the feeling
you don't love it.
Okay, I-I don't love it.
It's just so...
Yellow.
Trust me. This will be great.
Besides, when you're in the room,
nobody's looking at
the walls anyway.
Well, you certainly
know how to sell yellow.
Excuse me.
I hear you're gettin' divorced.
And good morning to you.
I'm getting divorced, too,
so we both need guys.
I'm thinking we should hang.
Uh, I don't know how much
Lynette has told you about me,
but I'm really not
one for... hanging.
Look, one woman at
a bar is just sad.
But two, and it's
girls' night out.
So what do you say?
You up for a little stud hunting?
That's a lovely offer,
but I think I'm gonna pass.
Oh, come on.
We gotta get back in the game,
cut loose, let our hair down.
That hair does come down,
doesn't it?
Really, Renee, that is just
not how I like to meet men.
Well, how else you gonna meet 'em,
sittin' around your house?
You'd be surprised.
You've met someone already?
Maybe.
Wow.
A beautiful, classy woman
who can get a man without
leaving the house.
I don't see us being friends.
I don't know
how everything gets
so dirty in here.
Uh-oh!
Is that a piece of lint?
Oh, no!
It got my apron!
I'd better sign off before
I'm completely naked.
See you tomorrow, boys.
I'm busy!
Honey, it's Maxine!
Oh!
A star is born!
Did you watch?
Oh, not only did I watch,
I kvelled.
Oh! I have to admit,
I am sort of getting into it.
That whole thing with the
vacuum just came to m
well, that's how it happens
with the great ones. Oops.
Here's a bonus for you.
Whoa!
What's this for?
Well, it's a little something I do
for the girl who gets the
most hits in a month.
You just unseated Stacy Strauss,
and with the caboose on her,
that's not easy.
Oh, Maxine. You're so
good to me. Oh, honey.
Mmm. You know what?
Mike and I are finally
starting to save some money.
Well, don't save it all.
Buy yourself something nice.
You deserve it. Oh, by the way,
have you decided what you're
gonna do for tomorrow's show?
I'm gonna damp mop
in bikini briefs.
Ooh! Are you trying
to make me cry?
Bye, doll.
This is a great sandwich.
What's in it?
Oh, it's nothing.
Just a little Parma ham
cured by Italian monks
and some cave-aged gruyre,
and of course I make
my own fig mustard.
Cooking is a passion of mine.
Of course, it's not much
fun cooking for one,
so, um, if you're
free this weekend...
babe, you gotta try
this sandwich. It rocks.
This is my boss, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
This is Stephanie, my girlfriend.
You have a girlfriend?
Of course you have a...
A girlfriend who's
young and pretty.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry, Bree.
What were you about to ask me?
Oh, it's, uh, wasn't important.
You enjoy your sandwich.
Inside, over there.
Let the stud hunt begin.
Come on. Come on.
We're gonna get started.
You okay?
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's play cards.
When I was 8, daddy left mama,
and we were pretty much alone.
Most of my friends were
either stuffed or plastic.
Of course, there were
always mama's boyfriends,
but as soon as I'd
learn their names,
mama would kick them out,
and there'd be a new
toothbrush in the bathroom.
Uh, l-let me know if
I'm sharing too much.
No. Not at all.
Keep pouring the chardonnay.
She's cracking like an egg.
Okay, quarter ante.
So, Beth, how did you
and Paul meet anyway?
Oh, I don't wanna bore you.
We won't be bored.
More chardonnay?
Mm.
Well... I saw his picture in
the paper during his trial,
and there was just
something about those eyes
that spoke to me.
What about the headline?
"Arrested for murder"-
that didn't speak to you?
I'll admit that gave me pause.
But then we started corresponding,
and I discovered
what a wonderful
man Paul really is.
Bree, let's forget about hittin'
the clubs tomorrow night.
Clearly, all the best
guys are on death row.
But, hey, you can't help who
you fall in love with, right?
And Paul's a real lady-killer.
We... we always fogged up the
plexiglas with that one.
Well, it's good that
you can laugh about it.
The thing is,
in my heart, I always
knew he was innocent,
and I was right.
Well, he is.
Yeah, so let's play cards.
what are you doing?
Preparing to take my medicine.
I've heard that an
increase in appetite's
a possible side effect,
so I'm taking the
necessary precautions.
Necessary precautions being your
own weight in cheese doodles?
I never smoked pot before,
so I wanna be prepared.
Headphones?
Pink Floyd.
Apparently, it complements
the medicinal properties
of, uh...
Blueberry bliss.
Listen to you.
You are loving this.
Tom the college rd
gets to finally smoke
pot and be cool.
Hey, I was plenty cool in college.
The only reason I
didn't smoke back then
was because I signed
the abstinence pledge
with my dungeons & dragons club.
So... what do you say?
Care to join me out
back behind the garage
for a little doobage?
"Doobage"?
That's what you're calling
your medicine now?
Come on. You need to
take this seriously.
I-I am.
Really? 'Cause I'm pretty
sure I've never asked you
to join me behind the
garage to split a midol.
Lynette, you said you
would go with this.
I know, but how is it
gonna look to the kids?
I don't want them
seeing their dad stoned.
Oh, you... you don't have to worry
about them seeing me stoned.
They'll never know.
Hey, the...
okay.
So what do you wanna
do Saturday night?
Well, I was thinking
that we could go to Chez Naomi.
Isn't our price range
more Chez chicken hut?
Mike, it's our anniversary.
Besides, we've been working
really hard. We deserve it.
Okay, but bring your big purse
'cause we're taking
the dinner rolls home.
So...
Chez Naomi, huh?
Expensive place.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is.
Must be nice.
Um, have we met?
I'm in 1b. Susan Delfino.
Oh, I know who you are.
I'm 1f.
Stacy Strauss.
Uh, y-you're one of Maxine's...
Yeah.
Oh, well, it's nice to meet you.
Guess we...
Kind of do the same thing.
Oh, sometimes we do
exactly the same thing.
What does that mean?
I keep an eye on the competition.
You lifted one of my moves.
No, I didn't. You expect me to
believe you just woke up one day
and decided to put a feather
duster in your mouth? You do that?
It's my signature bit,
and you stole it.
I swear. I...
I-I don't watch the
other girls perform.
Okay, so I guess it's
just a coincidence.
Well, here's another coincidence...
you're getting the big
bonus check, and I'm not.
That's not... really what
you'd call a coincidence.
That's really more
all right, college.
Just keep the duster
out of your mouth.
And watch your back.
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
I am wasted.
Really?
I am Lucy in the sky high.
So...
This must be pretty
intense for you
and don't forget.
Tomorrow we have to
trombone 3-d banana patch.
Remember?
Man, this is, uh,
really strong stuff.
Snow shovel.
Exactly.
You know, I was just upstairs
watching Paige sleep,
with her little fingers
and her little toes.
I-I must've watched her for,
like, an hour.
She's just so perfect.
And I am so lucky.
I couldn't feel happier
than I do right now.
I mean just so happy it's working.
Yeah.
What do you think? Does this say
"happy anniversary, Mike.
I'll love you forever"?
No. I think it says
"credit card declined."
Aren't you and Mike on a budget?
Yeah, but things are starting
to turn around lately.
I've been selling a
lot of my jewelry.
Get out!
Out there and keep selling.
Oh, hello, silk!
Oh, how I've missed
your soft touch.
I'm going to the dressing room.
Mm, you two have fun.
Mommy?
Oh. You're not my mommy.
Are you lost,
sweetie? What's your name?
Kiki! You scared me!
I couldn't find you.
I have a little girl, too.
Sometimes they get
distracted and wander off.
Let's go.
Wait!
How old is she? 8.
My daughter's 8.
When's your birthday?
Uh, we've really gotta go.
Uh, okay, but, uh,
what hospital was she born in?
Was it Fairview memorial?
Standing there in the mall,
it just hit me.
I can't spend the rest of my life
wondering if every little
girl I see is my daughter.
Not knowing where she is,
it... it's like my heart
living outside of my body.
??
Well, there's a private
Detective I work with.
But Sanchez is a
pretty common name.
It's not surprising the
hospital couldn't find 'em.
But I know something
the hospital doesn't.
When I was in labor,
the other woman's mother
came into my room by mistake,
and we got to talking.
She lived in el Paso,
and she was so excited to have
her granddaughter baptized
at Santa Maria's church.
That's gonna help.
So you think you can find her?
We'll do our best.
Carlos is on board
with this, right?
Absolutely.
Okay, then give me
ten porterhouse.
Hey. I just came by to pick
up my envelope for the week.
Okay. Inside.
And don't listen to
this conversation.
It's about your Christmas gift.
I'm buying all my girls steaks.
You got a preference?
Whatever meat you put
in my stocking will be fine.
Ooh, that sounds dirty. Use that.
I'm back.
What else have you got for me?
Rib eye? I like it.
Is that a piece of lint?
That's my bit.
Max... Maxine!
What?! I'm on with the meat guy.
Yeah, but Stacy Strauss
is stealing my vacuum bit!
Oh, my God. Well,
if she's gonna do that,
at least teach her how
to use the nozzle.
Hey there. I'm ready to party.
Are you? 'Cause you look like
you're ready to tour
the Reagan library.
This is a cocktail cardigan.
Look closely.
The buttons are shiny.
Where's your closet?
I have never seen so
many sweater sets.
Are you sure this is a closet
and not a portal to the 1950s?
There is nothing wrong
with my clothing.
Bree, you're going
to a hot young club
full of hot young people.
You need to dress the part.
Well, I happen to
find it distasteful
when mutton is dressed as lamb.
Look, when women go out clubbing,
there's two ways
they can pair up...
pretty girl/pretty girl
or pretty girl/grenade.
Which do you wanna be?
Fine.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Love the plunging neckline.
That's the back.
Ugh. This place is dead.
Really?
I forgot we were in the sticks.
Clearly, everyone hooked up early
so they could be home
in time for "nightline."
Actually, tonight's "nightline"
sounds very interesting.
It's about the genocide in r...
hold on.
Fresh talent at the
end of the bar.
Oh, that's my contractor.
Well, call me a fixer-upper.
Oh, don't... don't bother.
He's, uh, got a girlfriend.
If I don't see her,
she doesn't exist.
What's so funny?
My girlfriend's about to
make a fool of herself.
She's hitting on that guy,
and I happen to know
he has a very beautiful,
very young girlfriend.
You talking about Keith?
You know him?
Yeah, and Stephanie
dumped him this afternoon,
which is why he's here,
drowning his sorrows.
Bree. Wow.
I didn't recognize you.
Keith, what a lovely surprise.
I didn't know you were here.
Yeah.
But I'm bagging.
I gotta work tomorrow.
Boss is pretty strict.
Good. I mean, yes,
I'm very strict.
See you in the morning.
There ya go. That's
how you bait the hook.
Oh, I won't need a ride.
I'm going home with Keith.
Oh, I don't think so.
He just left.
Oh, he's pulling the car around.
Now you think I should play
the "I hate going into a
dark house alone" card,
or the more blatant
"I'm not wearing underwear"?
'Cause I'm not.
Okay, before you
do anything hasty,
he just broke up with his girlfriend.
He's very fragile.
Oh. I'll be careful
when I unwrap him.
Renee, wait. Please don't
go home with Keith.
Why?
Oh, he's the one you like,
isn't he?
I am... I am thinking about you.
You don't want to come
off like a slut.
Aw, gee, then chip won't
ask me to the prom.
Renee, wait! What about me?
Oh, it's getting late.
Stay in the dim light and
don't play hard to get.
Keith, hi. It's Bree.
I-I don't know if
you're in bed yet,
but I'm having a bit
of an emergency.
Oh, thank you. That's lovely.
Why would somebody do
something like this?
Far be it from me to understand
the minds of hooligans.
I'm so sorry to call you
over here at this hour.
Oh, it's okay.
I wasn't doing anything special.
Good.
I would love to show
my appreciation.
I was wondering if perhaps
one night this week,
I could make you dinner.
Oh. You mean...
Like a date?
Well, we don't have
to put a label on it.
Just two adults eating...
Food together.
Calling it a date is quicker.
Well, I see no reason to argue.
Shall we say...
00 P.M. on Thursday?
M-Mrs. McCluskey, right?
Yeah.
I was hoping I might see you
at the girls' poker game.
Not anymore.
You get caught with a
couple of aces in your bra,
and you're banned for life.
I-I couldn't help but notice
they don't seem to like
my husband very much.
Do you know why that is?
Nope. Nobody tells me anything.
Mrs. McCluskey,
I really need to know.
Okay, fine. They think
he's a murderer.
But he was exonerated.
Felicia Tillman framed him.
Yeah, for that crime.
What do you mean?
Before Felicia showed
up around here,
her sister Martha was murdered.
And, all due respect,
you're shacking up with
suspect number one.
Does everybody think that?
Felicia may be a few fingers
short of a high five,
but if she's crazy, we all are.
Well, that's enough
dusting for today, boys.
I guess all that's left
is a little vacuuming.
Ooh! Yay! Get the vacuum.
I think I got some
schmutz on my apron.
Ooh, get that off.
Oh, I love this show. Mm.
Hello, boys.
For those of you
who might be switching
over from other channels,
welcome.
I have a very dirty apartment.
Open up!
Uh, little busy!
I know you did it.
Did what? I don't know
what you're talking about.
Oh, so you're not just a thief.
You're a liar.
Be careful how you talk to me,
you gigantic freak.
Oh, I am about to slap that
cheap blush right off your face.
Is that supposed to scare me,
man hands?
I'm gonna show you
a whole new place to stick
that feather duster.
Well, I'm sure wherever it is,
you copied the idea
from watching me.
-I need those bonus checks!
-So do I!
You don't get it. I am trying
to get out of this business!
Oh, and you think I wanna
spend the rest of my life
dusting in my underwear?
! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You're off camera!
Roll left.
Oh, Maxine.
I'm so glad you're here.
What are you doing?
She attacked me. That's because
she broke into my apartment and...
hang on. This isn't a bit?
No! I was in the middle
of doing my show,
and she burst in here
and started hitting me.
Did you do that?
Yeah, but...
you know the rules, Strauss!
You never, ever interrupt a show!
Now go to your room.
But I... I said go.
You all right, honey?
Yeah.
All right. Good.
I-I gotta call tech support.
You girls had so many hits,
it fried my router.
So...
A roving gang of hooligans
destroyed your sprinklers?
Shameful, isn't it?
You know what I think?
I think this is the hairwork
of a lonely, desperate woman.
You left out "resourceful."
Nobody steals a man out of my bed.
But you know what?
I've been looking for a new hobby,
and taking you down
is as good as any.
I think you'd be wise to
stick to your original hobby
of forgoing undergarments.
Be seeing you, Bree.
Looking forward to it.
Maxine says I can't go back online
until I apologize to you,
so... I apologize.
Wow. And I thought your acting
was bad on the web site.
Fine. I am sorry, okay?
I shouldn't have stolen your bit.
What was going through your mind?
I freaked out when I didn't
get that bonus check.
See, my family's in Virginia,
and I'm saving up
to move back home.
Yeah, well,
I know what that's like.
And even with that extra money,
I always feel like I'm
living week to week.
Really? 'Cause when I
broke in your apartment,
I noticed that you had
some awfully nice stuff.
Flat screen TV,
closet full of new clothes.
I know. Probably shouldn't
have bought all that.
But you know how it is.
Every once in a while,
you want a little splurge.
Yeah, I get that.
But... definitely by
the end of the year,
I'm going to be outta here.
Me, too.
How long have you been doing this?
Um... gosh. I guess I'm
going on six years.
Hey, um... would you mind
if we just stayed home
and ordered Chinese
for our anniversary?
Wait. No suit?
No tie?
No pretentious euro
waiter listing specials
that I can't understand?
Dang it, Susan! Why?
Seriously, why'd you
change your mind?
I thought you wanted
a little treat.
Oh. I think we should
save that money
and stay focused on
what we're trying to do.
And we can have a fancy
dinner and celebrate
when we move back home.
I had a lovely time at the
poker game the other day.
Really? What's the
neighborhood saying about me?
Well...
For starters,
a lot of people seem
to think you killed...
What's her name? Martha something.
Huber.
I guess Felicia Tillman
spread her poison pretty wide.
I guess she did.
I'm not a murderer, you know.
I know.
But I fell in love with
you before I knew that,
so even if you were...
I'm always gonna be on your side.
Remember that.
Everything okay? You...
You look a little...
It's been an intense couple weeks.
I'm sorry, buddy.
What if I told you
I could ease some of that stress?
You're not gonna offer
me a back rub, are you?
Nope.
A mind rub.
So you got this from a doctor?
Really cool doctor.
Now I gotta warn you,
this stuff is chronic.
I got totally baked off
of it this morning.
I did not have you
pegged as a stoner.
Dude...
There's a lot that you
don't know about me.
Tom?
I hate to break
this to you, but...
This isn't pot.
Tell me that in five minutes
when we are soaring past
the rings of Saturn.
Trust me, cheech. This is oregano.
No way. I bo... I bo--
I bought it at a legit dispensary.
Then somebody must have
switched it on you,
'cause the only thing getting
baked with that herb is lasagna.
*** who would do that?
You! Oh, jeez. You scared me.
I know what you did.
Whatever do you mean?
Oh, yeah. That was me.
Th-this isn't funny, Lynette!
Tom, you thought you
were getting stoned
on a pizza topping.
It's a little funny.
My sense of betrayal
is huge at this moment.
Well, why don't you snort
some baking powder?
-You'll feel better.
-I'm glad you're enjoying this.
Glad you enjoy
making a fool of me.
That was not my intention.
I only threw out the pot because
I didn't think you needed it,
and you know, I was right.
You got happy all on your own.
Don't try to justify what you did
by making it seem like
some sort of "master plan."
It wasn't a master plan.
I lucked out because
for some reason,
while you were... high on oregano,
you made a decision
to live in the moment.
You stood over our daughter's crib
and you let go of the
stress and the fear,
and you focused on the
good in your life.
But I am sorry I tricked you.
You're evil.
I should have expected it.
Where are you going?
To look at our beautiful daughter.
Then I gotta turn that bong
I made back into a lamp.
Anything?
We found them.
Oh, my God. What'd they say?
I haven't called them yet.
Are you sure you still wanna do this?
What? Yes, of course.
Gaby, you need to realize,
once we call these people,
and they know what's happened,
it'll change your family forever.
Call them.
Juanita, come in here.
I didn't do it.
I know.
I was putting on some ketchup.
I thought you might like some.
Can you put the big
fake eyelashes on me?
Of course, and... big rosy cheeks.
Look how grown-up you are.
Before you know it,
you're gonna be going to college,
have boyfriends, get married.
I'm not getting married.
I don't wanna leave
you and daddy... ever.
Juanita...
Do you know how much I love you?
To the moon and back.
That's right.
No matter what happens,
I will always love you
to the moon and back.
Hey, Carlos, I need to sit
down with you and Gaby.
Why?
I just called the family.
It got pretty intense.
What are you talking about?
And now in a selection
from Dior's fall line,
the world's newest
supermodel... Juanita!
Hold the world in contempt.
That's it.
Now you look like a model.
Oh, hi, daddy.
Hey, Carlos. What's wrong?
I just spoke to Bob.
Sweetie, why don't
you go to your room?
And I'll be there in a sec.
How could you have
done this? Carlos...
we talked about this! We agreed.
No, you agreed. You rushed me
into signing that piece of paper
without giving me a chance to
think about what I was doing.
Don't you understand
what could happen?
She is our flesh and blood,
and she's out there!
I need to know how she's doing.
I need to know she's okay!
And what if they
want Juanita back?!
They can take her from us.
They can do that now!
They're not gonna wanna
give up their own daughter.
We don't know that!
We don't know anything about them!
And you have no idea
what you've started here!
Mommy!
Coming, sweetie!
If this ends badly,
I will never forgive you.
I mean it, Gabrielle.
We're done.
Happiness...
It's something
everyone searches for.
Some are sure they'll find it
once they've moved back home.
Some think they'll find
it by making a new friend.
Some hope to find it
once they've defeated
the competition.
Then there are those who
stop searching for happiness
because they look up
one day to discover...
It was right there in f of them
all the time.
Sync by YYeTs.net
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Bree discovered she had a romantic rival.
I've been looking for a new
hobby, and taking you down
is as good as any.
Susan got a bonus.
For the girl who gets
the most hits in a month.
Since the prison didn't
allow conjugal visits,
this is our wedding night.
Paul's bride said no.
There are certain wifely duties
that I don't want to rush into.
Once we call these people,
it'll change your family forever.
And Gaby decided to
meet her real daughter.
Call them.
Carlos Solis loved his wife
more than anything...
If there's a woman on this
planet with better skin,
I'd like to meet her.
Even though she was vain...
Do we have to give money
to the church every Sunday?
I mean, it's always the same show.
Selfish...
I told you to buy me couture!
I can't wear off-the-rack
with these shoes!
And spoiled.
But in those moments when his
wife was simply vulnerable...
You okay?
Carlos loved her just a little bit more.
This is where we're meeting them?
I think so.
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
Start with "hello."
And then what?
"Thanks for raising our daughter
for the last eight years.
Hope we didn't ruin yours"?
It's gonna be fine.
Mrs. and Mrs. Solis? I'm Hector Sanchez.
Nice to meet you. And please,
ca us Carlos and Gabrielle.
Oh, thank you. Uh, where is...
Juanita is at the swing
set with her sister.
We thought we should talk a little first.
Oh. Sure.
Uh, my wife is over here with our...
She's with Grace.
That's her name? Grace?
Yes.
So how are you and your
wife handling all of this?
We're still in shock.
Since your lawyer called us,
we haven't been able to sleep or eat.
This whole thing is so crazy.
We feel the same way.
They couldn't have switched our babies.
It's got to be a mistake.
Maybe we should take a blood test.
Mom!
I told you to bring the green jacket!
I can't wear red with these shoes! Ugh!
Yes, Carlos Solis loved his wife...
I don't think we'll be needing that test.
And he knew her D.N.A.
when he saw it.
It's called a purse,
and as every woman knows,
it can hold just about anything,
from a personalized cell phone...
to a romance novel...
to much-needed medication.
Whatever you find inside,
there's one thing you can be sure of...
every purse says something
about the woman who owns it...
whether she knows it...
or not..
Carlos and I feel like we
shouldn't tell the girls,
you know, about what happened.
What do you guys think?
We should protect them.
Yes, but since we wanna get to
know our biological daughters,
we were thinking maybe the families could
get together every now and then?
Maybe once a month?
Mm, that sounds reasonable.
Uh, w... what do you think, Carmen?
Um, I guess.
Look at them.
Yes, I have a feeling that they
will become very good friends.
Can you believe those are our daughters?
Grace looks just like
me when I was her age.
And Juanita looks so much like my mother.
Mommy, can I have money for ice cream?
You just had lunch.
But they have chocolate chip. Grace.
Oh, let her have some. It's
hot. Come on. It'll be my treat.
Your purse is beautiful.
I know. Would you like to hold it?
Uh-huh.
It's so soft. I bet it cost a lot, right?
Grace, you don't ask about money.
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.
And just so you know, it's Chanel.
You can have one of these
by working very hard...
Or by marrying a man who works very hard.
Thank you!
What a polite little girl.
You have obviously done a
wonderful job, Mrs. Sanchez.
I mean, we didn't know what to expect,
but I can see Grace couldn't
have had a better mother.
You know what I mean.
Uh, y... you've done a
wonderful job with Juanita.
Thank you. You know, when I got pregnant,
I didn't know how I would handle
the whole motherhood thing...
Mom.
But I think I turned out
to be pretty good at it.
Mom!
What?!
I need money for ice cream.
What is the magic word?
I don't know. "Hurry"?
Now come on. The truck's pulling away.
"Please." The magic word is "please."
Fine. Please.
What, we can't afford more than one scoop?
I'm sorry. What was I saying?
You were talking about
what a good mother you are.
Say good-bye to your truck loan.
God, can you believe it?
Just two months ago, we
were up to our neck in debt.
Now we're only up to our ass.
If we keep this going,
we could reach flat broke
in time for Christmas.
Hello? It's Maxine.
Um, uh, I'm in here with Mike!
It's open!
Hello, Michael!
Look at this punim.
Oh, Mike, if I was 15 years younger,
I'd ride you like a hobo rides a boxcar.
Thanks. But you still have
to fix the air conditioner.
Eh, it was worth a shot.
I'm gonna take a shower.
I need to talk some business with you.
Me, too.
I just bought a fur-trimmed
Teddy and some floor Polish.
Tomorrow is gonna be a heck of a show.
Fantastic.
I think you should quit.
What?
The web site's going through some changes.
I've taken on some partners
who are pumping a lot of
cash into the business,
and they're running the show
now, and they want a huge
U.S. presence.
No. No, no, you promised me
that no one here would ever see me.
I did, and that's why
you need to get out now.
But Mike and I are just
getting back on track.
Yesterday, we got our first water bill
that didn't come with a threat.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Well, how long do I have
till all this happens?
A couple of weeks, a month tops.
Okay. I'll work right
up until the last day.
Give me double shifts, extra
shows. I'll do anything.
You got it.
I'm gonna miss you, honey.
No one will ever wear the rubber
gloves and the fishnets like you do.
Okay, we get it. You're unhappy.
We got it in every aisle at the market,
we got it four times during the night,
and we get it now!
Mom, I'll put the groceries away.
Oh. No.
Stop. Freeze.
Do nothing. No sudden movements.
The eyes are closing.
But we bought ice cream.
Let it melt.
Hello? Hello? Yes, this is she.
Oh. Of course I did.
Thank you. Thank you. I... I will be back.
Everything okay?
No, I left my license at the store,
so I have to drag Paige back there,
which will lead to another
2-hour screaming fit.
If I didn't look so good in
that photo, I'd get a new one.
Why don't you leave the baby with me?
Oh, honey, I don't know.
Mom, you leave her with the boys,
and they don't change her diaper
until it weighs as much as she does.
Good point.
I'm back.
I'm back! Everything okay?
She woke up, so I went with plan "b."
You traded her in for a quieter baby?
Nope. I changed her diaper.
Now we're doing a little floor time.
You changed her diaper.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
I've seen you do it a hundred times.
You're so good with her.
How would you feel about
me taking a quick shower
to wash some of this
vomit out of my hair...
from yesterday?
Why don't you take a bath? Light
one of those scented candles.
Whoever raised you did a brilliant job!
Mwah!
Shoot.
I'm out of aspirin.
Do you have a headache?
Uh, no. My back is a little sore.
You do realize, darling, that
your back wouldn't hurt so much
if you weren't sleeping
on a couch every night.
Uh, n... no. Uh, the couch is fine.
Um, I just pulled a muscle.
Hey there.
Lee.
Congratulations.
You are the proud new
owner of your old house.
You bought your old house?
Actually, Lee, why don't we talk later?
Okay. Well, here are your keys,
your complimentary
endangered species calendar,
and a kitchen magnet with my face on it.
Yes, I know I look cross-eyed,
but they assure me they will
correct that in the next batch.
Enjoy.
Why would you buy that house?
I thought it was a good investment.
But why buy... that one?
There are other homes
for sale around here.
Escrow's closed, Beth.
I see no point in discussing this further.
You won't discuss it?
I'm your wife.
Isn't it convenient how
during the day you're my wife,
but at night, you turn
back into a house-guest?
No, no, no. Don't look at
them yet. They're not done.
This isn't about the shutters.
It's about our... date Friday.
You still haven't told
me what we're doing.
Well, I can't tell you yet,
but I've been working on something
that I'm pretty... stoked about.
Well, that sounds lovely.
I, too, am... stoked.
You got a little paint...
What are you doing?
Shh!
Are you spying on Bree again?
Why would he want her
when he could have me?
She's way too old for him.
You're the exact same age.
I am not. I'm only thirty...
Are you gonna lie about your age?
We were college roommates.
All right, damn it.
Besides, Bree's always looked young.
When she used to go out with her grandkid,
people would think he was her son.
Wait. Bree's a grandmother?
How did I not know this?
Okay, sweetie, I am taking
the baby over to Gaby's.
The girls are meeting for
poker. I'll be back in a few.
You're not staying?
No. I'm really just doing a drive-by.
Last week, Paige spit up on Gaby's couch,
so now she's pretty much baby non grata.
Why don't you just leave her with me?
Then you can stay for your game.
But we usually play for a couple of hours.
Give me a kiss.
So? You'll be right
next door if I need you.
Oh, don't toy with me.
I'm operating on two hours
of sleep. I'm vulnerable.
Go. We'll be fine.
I love watching my baby sister.
Oh!
It's fun.
Penny Lynn Scavo,
you are officially my favorite.
We are gonna leave
everything to you in our will.
Keep in mind we're poor,
so it's rely more of a symbolic gesture.
Listen, guys,
uh, before we start...
I've been keeping something from you,
but I'm gonna tell you because
you're my dearest and oldest friends.
Well, I've only known you two weeks,
but I don't want to be
rude and tell you to leave.
See this picture? This
is my daughter Grace.
Oh, my God. Gaby.
I can't imagine what you're going through.
I'd be out of my mind.
How can you function?
Well, we were knocked sideways at first,
but since we met Grace,
it's been a blessing.
Thank God the parents are lovely.
I mean, this is the kind of
thing you see on the news.
Who else knows about this?
Very few people,
and I need you guys to keep it that way.
Well, of course we'll be discreet.
Definitely, for Juanita's sake.
Oh, don't worry about me.
Up until today, I
thought you were Juanita.
So... tell us what it was like.
Amazing.
I looked into her eyes and felt that pull.
Well, you carried her for nine months.
There's this one thing she
did that was incredibly moving.
She came up to me...
and within two seconds of touching my bag,
she knew it was expensive.
Now that is a hallmark moment.
You don't understand.
When I was a kid,
I used to sneak "Vogues"
out of my aunt's hair salon
and make my own high fashion paper dolls.
I know what it's like to be that kid,
with her face pressed against
the department store window.
Grace is me at her age.
So I decided to do something for her.
Her own little starter Chanel.
You are the best mother ever.
Paul?
Paul?
What are you doing?
Please go home.
I just wanna understand, that's all.
Are we going to move here?
No.
Then why would you buy this house?
It must be filled with so
many unpleasant memories.
I don't see any unpleasant memories.
I see the couch
where my wife and I would sit
and have our morning coffee
I see the Christmas tree in
the corner by the fireplace.
I see the chair...
where I would sit and
read stories to my son.
I was loved in this house.
I had a real marriage here.
Our marriage is real, Paul.
It's just...
this is hard for me,
and... and you keeping things from me
doesn't make it any easier.
You're right.
There should be no secrets between us.
Secrets are why this
house is empty right now.
Sorry I'm late, but I
think you'll be happy
when you hear why.
Black Eyed Peas. Row 15, center.
How cool is that?
Wow, that's just...
Wow.
You like them, right?
Of course.
You sound a little... underwhelmed.
No. Not at all.
I live to rock.
You know, I'm not as
old as you might think.
Grandma!
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
Visiting. We're here all weekend.
Um... hello.
Hi.
Keith,
this is my daughter
Danielle and this is my...
her, uh, son Benjamin.
Danielle, this is my, um... friend Keith.
We were just... going out.
Grandma! Grandma! Look what I bought you!
It's slippers.
My grandma has bad
circulation. Don't you, grandma?
Please stop calling me that!
You... precious child.
You know what? You guys came all this way.
You should spend tonight together.
No. No, no, no. If... if you
guys had plans, you should go.
We'll be fine.
Bree, there's... there's nothing
more important than family.
We'll go out another time.
You're very sweet.
Nice meeting both of you.
Uh, thank you so much.
Uh, I guess I heard wrong.
You seem to be bouncing back just fine.
What are you talking about?
When your friend called,
she said you were having a
hard time since Orson left.
Uh, by any chance,
is this friend named Renee?
She sent us first class tickets.
I wish I had a friend like that.
Oh, trust me, you don't.
Oh, come on. Come on.
What the hell?
Maxine, pick up.
They're already putting up a billboard.
You... you said they weren't
gonna start advertising
for a couple of... oh, my God!
Wait! Wait! Stop!
Huh?
You... you can't put that up there! That's me.
So?
So... so people will see!
My friends will see!
Lady, with a body like that,
no one's even gonna
notice you have a head.
No, no, no! No, no!
You can't! No, stop! Oh!
What the hell are you doin'?
Protecting my dignity!
Hey there, Mrs. McCluskey.
Nice day, isn't it?
I've seen better. What do you want?
You're direct.
I love that about you.
Truth is, I was wondering
if you had any interest
in selling your home.
Well, get ready to love me again.
No.
Aren't you tired of
caring for this place...
the big lawn and all these stairs?
Yeah, your concern is touching.
What's your game here?
I just love this neighborhood so much,
I'd hate to see this house
fall into the wrong hands
after you're gone.
I'm not going anywhere.
I hope you're right,
but the years do he a way of flying by,
and I thought you might
wanna unload this place
while you still have the upper hand.
Upper hand?
Yes.
Right now you're sharp as a tack.
But one day, your hip will break
or you'll suffer a massive stroke,
and the doctors will say you
can longer live on your own.
And when that day comes,
potential buyers who don't
care about you like I do
will know that you're desperate.
They'll smell the blood in the water.
People will start smelling your blood
if you don't get off my porch.
All right. Didn't mean to upset you.
My offer still stands.
As I said,
it all comes from my great love
for this beautiful neighborhood.
Be careful on those stairs now.
Look who's missing her big sister.
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.
There. You are really so good with her.
Listen, I'm gonna take a quick
jog. Be back in 20 minutes.
Mom.
Yeah?
I've got a test today. I
cannot be late for the bus.
I hear ya loud and
clear. I'll be back in 15.
You might wanna smell her diaper.
I think she left you a little present.
Hey, Lynette?
Um, I need to talk to you.
Sure.
Oh. You're jogging again.
Where's, uh, the baby?
Uh, Penny is watching her.
It is the most amazing thing.
Only when you've spawned as much as I have
do you learn the glorious truth...
the older ones can watch the younger ones.
Babies having babies... bad.
Babies raising babies... genius!
I'm happy for you.
You don't look happy.
That's why we need to talk.
Okay.
She flew them here first
class? That is vintage Renee.
Yes, a voracious lido
and unlimited funds...
a deadly combination.
And now she's taking Keith
to dinner tomorrow night.
How did you find that out?
Well, he called to
make sure it was okay...
which, course, it isn't.
But what could I say?
Don't say anything.
Wait till she's crossing the
street and then run her over.
No, I'm too fond of my car.
You have to fight back somehow.
It's the only thing Renee understands.
But how? I mean, you
know her better than I do.
What could I do to humiliate her?
She once slept with a rodeo clown...
But he's a senator now. Uh...
Oh, she's got this
really weird belly button.
But by the time he finds that
out, they're already getting it on.
She used to freak out whenever
"The wizard of Oz" was on tv.
Why?
Mm, I think it was the munchkins.
There's something about little people
that gives her the heebie-jeebies.
Oh, crap! Penny's gonna
be late for school.
Sorry I couldn't help.
Oh, no. You helped.
Penny!
I'm sorry! I forgot my phone!
Uh, grab your stuff, and I'll drive you!
Wha...
where's my baby?
Stop breathing on my sister!
Hi. I'm Lynette Scavo.
I need to find my daughter Penny.
Yeah. We've been expecting you.
Principal's office is in the back.
Oh. Thank you.
You're in so much trouble.
So...
You left your 2-month-old baby
in the care of your 11-year-old daughter.
What can I say?
I'm not one of those helicopter parents.
Come on.
Give me a break. I am raising five kids.
You have no idea how hard that is.
Eight?
Well, clearly, you're very competitive.
I talked to Penny.
I think you should know
she's helping you out
more than you realize.
What do you mean?
Do you know Penny takes the
baby monitor to bed with her
so she can get up for the feedings?
She does?
As a result,
the poor girl is exhausted.
She fell asleep in
social studies yesterday.
I had no idea.
Oh, my gosh.
Yes, I will talk to
Penny when she gets home,
and I will fix this.
Yes, that would be nice.
Okay.
You know what? Enough
with the judgmental tone.
Come on. Who among us is a perfect mother?
Gaby.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.
I was just hoping Grace would be home.
I thought we were supposed to call first
if we wanted to see the kids.
I know, I know, but I
was in the neighborhood.
Uh, is she here?
No.
Okay. Well, could you
give this to her for me?
Thank you, but Grace already has a purse.
Really? Is it Chanel?
No. We bought it at a flea market for $2,
and she's very happy with it.
I know, but don't you think she'd
like this one a little better?
Not if she never sees it.
Don't you think I would like
to give my children nice things?
We're not like you.
We can't afford luxuries. We can
barely afford the necessities.
Look, if you guys need help...
What we need is for you
to let us be who we are,
not who you are.
Goodbye, Gaby.
Please, call next time.
You said I had a month.
I said I thought it was a month.
It's the Internet.
Everything moves very fast.
How many billboards are there?
They talked about a big ad
campaign, so I guess a lot.
You have got to call them.
Get them to stop it, or at least
put some other girl up there.
Something.
Honey, I tried to warn you.
It's beyond my control now.
Please help me.
What if Mike sees me splayed
across that billboard?
He's gonna recognize those panties!
He gave them to me for our anniversary!
I'll make a call.
I'm sorry I took the baby to school.
I had a math test, and
I didn't want to be late.
Hey, sweetie. Hey. Hey.
You didn't do anything wrong.
I did.
Come here. Sit down.
I understand you've been
taking the baby monitor
into your room at night.
Just so you can sleep.
I appreciate that,
and I appreciate how oft
you have been looking
after your little sister.
Well, I know how you like
to go see your friends
and go jogging and stuff.
Yeah, I do.
And you're different when
you get to do those things.
You laugh more. You're not as cranky.
You stay up late and
play board games with us.
I like that mommy better.
I like that mommy better, too.
But it's not your job to take care of.
Your job is to...
watch television and
eat way too much candy.
And my job is to make sure
that's all your job is.
Okay.
Off you go.
That...
was really sweet.
I know.
Get me a nanny.
What?
I am drowning here.
You heard what Penny said.
I'm not myself anymore.
And when I'm not taking
it out on the kids,
I'm taking advantage
of them. So I need help.
How about if I pitch in more?
Oh, Tom.
What a lovely, hollow offer
that you'll never back up.
Get me a nanny.
You bought an 8-year-old
girl a $1,400 purse?
Oh, lighten up. It's not like
I got her the matching wallet.
So what did Carmen say?
She went all "Grapes of wrath" on me,
'cause God forbid that woman let
her daughter have nice things.
"That woman" is her mother,
and I'm with her on this.
You have no right to give
Grace expensive gifts.
Yes, I do.
Why?
Because she was supposed
to have all this stuff!
We were supposed to give it to her.
This is why I didn't
want us to look for her,
because we had no idea what
would happen once we found her.
But you looked, and we met her,
and now we're falling
in love with this girl.
And if you spook these people,
they can take her away from us forever.
Morning, Mrs. McCluskey.
How are you today?
I feel great. Sorry to disappoint you.
Oh. Oh... what?
Just had my annual physical.
Doc says I'm gonna be around for years.
So you can tell that
vulture husband of yours
he'll have to pick at
someone else's carcass.
What are you talking about?
Something smells good.
I'm making stew.
So... how was your day?
Fine.
Anything interesting happen?
No, not really.
You didn't...
talk to anyone?
Who would talk to me?
I'm gonna go wash up.
You are going to love the sea urchin.
Looks a little sketchy.
Most of the fish I eat
comes in a basket with fries.
You're funny.
And you eat out of a basket.
I like that.
Everything okay?
I just thought I saw...
never mind.
So... anyway,
I thought after dinner
we could go to a club.
What do you think of jazz?
I think it's the sea urchin of music.
Okay, um, did you see that?
See what?
It was probably nothing. Um...
I thought I saw...
Okay, you're...
you're just a kid.
What is the matter with you?
I'm so sorry.
I don't want you to think I'm odd.
Y... you see, when... I was a child,
there was this incident... at the circus.
And ever since then,
I have always been terrified of...
Hey! Don't I know you?
Get him away! Get him away! Get him away!
What's wrong?!
Is he there with his tiny hands?
I can't look at his tiny hands!
I am... I am so sorry.
I don't know what the hell she's doing.
It's okay.
Obviously, I made a mistake.
Oh, my God. Did he go? I can't look.
He's gone.
So come down.
Everyone is staring.
You should've seen the look on her face.
Well, I couldn't see her,
but I certainly heard her...
and it was magnificent.
Happy to help out. Bye,
Bree. See ya in church.
$9,000?
Hey, my partners spent a lot of
money printing those billboards.
And they'll agree not to put them up,
but they are not gonna eat the cost.
Honey, I did the best I could.
I talked them down from $12,000.
It's still a huge hit.
I mean, it puts us
right back where we were
before I started doing this stuff.
I know.
And what's Mike gonna say when
he notices the money is missing?
Oh, God. I hadn't even thought of that.
Maybe I should just let
them put up the billboards.
At least then when he
kills me, I'll be famous.
You know, there is another way.
What do you mean?
Well, you could earn that
money back, and fast, too.
But you'd have to...
Never mind. Forget I said anything.
No, no. What? What... what is it?
Well, there are other services
our web site provides...
things I've kept hidden from you
because of the boundaries you've set.
But if you're willing to go
beyond those boundaries...
Are you talking about prostitution?
God, no!
Nothing like that!
Just private on-screen interactions
of a... racier nature.
How racy?
How much money do you wanna make?
How dare you.
Good morning, Renee.
How dare you exploit a
traumatic childhood memory.
Yes, I heard you had some sort
of episode with a little person.
Oh, look. He followed you home.
Very funny. I wonder how Keith will react
when I tell him it was
you who ruined our date.
About the same as when he finds out
you used my grandson to ruin ours.
Oh. Here's Keith now.
Why don't we ask him
who he wants to be with?
We can't...
put him on the spot like that.
Bree, you're getting all red.
Is that a hot flash or
you just losing your nerve?
I was gonna finish up with those sconces.
Everything okay here?
Not exactly.
Can we ask you something?
If you had to choose between...
forest green or brown
for the trim, which would you prefer?
Forest green... I guess.
Great. Then why don't you, uh,
run down to the hardware store
and have them mix you up a batch?
Scoot.
What's the matter,
Bree? Afraid you'll lose?
You know what?
I think I am.
He's all yours.
Well, that's not any fun.
I thought you liked him.
I do, but... I don't get his references.
I can't stay up late like he does.
I'm being silly.
I feel like one of tho
clichs people make fun of...
the desperate, predatory divorce.
You mean like me?
Well, yeah.
Do you know why people make fun of us?
They're jealous,
because we still have the
guts to go after what we want.
You think he can make you happy?
I think so.
Then go for it.
My gift to you.
Why are you being so nice to me?
Based on my dinner under
the rainbow last night,
I'd rather have you as
a friend than an enemy.
Now go.
Keith, hang on! I think I'll join you!
Uh, really nice of you to have us over.
Maybe next time you
can come to our house.
Absolutely.
You know, I think it's great
that out of this unfortunate situation,
we could all end up being friends.
Yes. We're very lucky people.
Bet you can't catch me!
Bet you can't catch me!
So now we pinch off a small piece of masa,
and you roll it into a ball.
Is this big enough?
It's perfect. Ay.
I really love your house Mrs. Solis.
Oh, well, thank you, honey.
Would you like a tour?
Uh-huh. Come on.
Wow. It's so big.
You have a tv in your bedroom?
Lucky.
Yes, we are very lucky.
Is that a jewelry box?
You want to take a look?
Yeah.
It's all so pretty.
I can't wait till I grow up
so I can have beautiful things.
You like that?
It's a gift I bought myself
with my first big modeling check.
I want you to have it. You
deserve beautiful things.
I don't know. My mom might get mad.
Then we'll make it... our little secret.
Thank you.
I want a purse like that someday.
Well, then I'm gonna make sure you get it.
It's called a purse,
and as every woman knows,
it can hold just about anything...
from a bottle for a baby...
to a check for protection...
to a gift for a new friend.
Whatever you find inside,
there's one thing you can be sure of...
every purse says something
about the woman who owns it...
whether she knows it or not.

Previously on...
Bree's affair with her
contractor broke new ground.
Perhaps we could make
you dinner. Like a date?
I can't wait till I ow up so
I can have beautiful things.
Gaby doted on her
biological daughter grace.
Looking who's missing
her big sister.
Lynette had too much on her hands.
Get me a nanny.
Susan found that keeping
her new job a secret...
My partners are not
gonna eat the cost.
$9,000?
Was going to be expensive.
But her secret had
already been discovered.
Emma Graham was an ordinary woman.
And like most ordinary women,
she had an extraordinary dream.
She wanted her husband to know
she was more than just a wife.
She wanted her daughter to know
she was more than just a mother.
She wanted her neighbors to know
she was more than just the
woman who lived next door.
So Emma made a decision
to turn her dream into reality.
I wanna do a cabaret show.
I'll need a band, orchestrations,
and sound equipment,
and you are gonna pay for all of it.
And that is how Emma Graham's
friends and neighbors
came to gather at the
smokehouse lounge
two weeks later.
They would soon learn
Emma Graham wasn't so
ordinary after all.
Yes, Emma's dream of
sharing her talent
had finally come true.
Unfortunately, the high note
that ended the evening...
Did not come from Emma.
I'm gonna kill you!
You whore!
Okay, ladies, please!
Uhh! Oh, my nose!
My nose, my nose. Aah!
She knew what she
was doing was wrong.
She knew it was very dangerous.
She knew the risks
if people found out.
But Susan Delfino was determined
to get back to Wisteria Lane,
and that is how her world
began to fall apart.
Hi. I'm Tanya.
Thank you for choosing
to spend time with me.
I'm all yours for the next hour.
How about we start
by getting to know each
other a little better?
Show me your jugs.
Aren't you...
A frisky little... ooh!
I see some dirt under
the coffee table.
Would you like me to vacuum?
Sure, right after you take
out those tots and shake 'em.
Slow down.
We've got, um...
59 more minutes together.
And, uh...
Isn't it sexier to
warm each other up
with some... naughty talk first?
I have to listen
to my old lady's
blah-blah-blah all day long.
Lose the top so I can
see those money-makers.
What, are you reading
from a boob thesaurus?
Come on.
Isn't there some romantic fantasy
you'd like to share with me?
Okay.
Are you lactating?
Oh, pig!
You never do that.
You never pull the
plug on a session!
The guy was a total perv
who clearly had
serious mother issues.
You cost us a major client.
And God forbid he starts
talking about this at work.
We could lose the
whole city council!
I'm sorry.
I lost my nerve.
Susan, I can't keep giving
you chances like this.
Va-va-va-broom.
Oh, you want a private
session with Tanya.
I'm sorry.
That's not gonna happen.
She doesn't work for me anymore.
Oh, once again, I am so sorry.
I forgot that French
restaurant was so formal.
Next time, I will pick a
place with fewer forks.
Yeah, thanks again for
helping me out with that.
Well, I... I had a lot of fun.
Good night.
Keith?
Did you really have a lot of fun?
Yeah. Why do you ask?
Well, because it's our third date,
and you just
kissed me like you were saying
good night to your aunt.
I'm trying to treat
you like a lady.
Oh, that's sweet.
Now knock it off.
Three times?
In one night.
Oh, my God. Three times
is my entire September.
I just had the nicest
chat with grace.
She said the cutest thing.
Bree had sex three times last night.
Oh, screw my story. Tell.
The sex was amazing.
It was like... oh,
how to describe it?
An opera.
You fell asleep during it?
I'm telling you,
making love to a man in his 30s...
it's like... oh,
the... the sun shines brighter,
the grass looks greener,
food tastes better.
Okay, we get it.
You had sex three times.
Three!
Oh, hey, look.
Renee's back from New York.
Oh, God, you invited her?
What, now you don't like Renee?
I know she's your friend,
but isn't she kind of
a self-absorbed,
narcissistic diva?
Good point. We already
have one of those.
Drop the drugstore
champagne, ladies,
and make way for the real stuff.
We are celebrating!
What's the occasion?
Oh, my divorce settlement.
I just soaked my ex for... well,
a whole lot of these.
I thought there was a prenup.
Yep, there was,
but no prenup is a match
for the legal team of grind'em,
screw'em, and Rothenberg.
That was iced tea.
Well, I just made it fun.
Now I wanna have you all
over for dinner tonight.
I've got two more
cases of champagne,
a truckload of caviar,
and a pile of money
to roll around naked in.
What do you say?
If there's more of this,
I am definitely there.
Great. How about you, Bree?
Oh, I wish I could, but I have a date.
I need to carbo-load.
I've gotta pass, too.
We still haven't found a nanny,
and so Tom's working late,
so I have to go... yawn. Susan.
I would, but it's macaroni
and coupon clipping night
at my house.
Yawn and sad. Well,
I guess it's just you and me.
Gabs and nee.
That is great.
We were just talking about how
much you two have in common.
Weren't we, gabs?
Thanks so much.
Your baby's really cute.
It was nice meeting you.
We'll let you know. Thanks.
Well? Any luck finding a nanny?
No. I've interviewed eight girls.
They're all either
too inexperienced
or too expensive.
Hmm. What about the
one with the boobs?
And that's why we're
not hiring her.
Well, don't give up yet,
because I found us
one more applicant.
You did? You took the initiative?
Why so surprised?
Our Christmas lights are
still up from last year.
And not only is she punctual,
she's early.
Who is it? Um,
let me put it this way.
Lynette, remember how you
always used to hate yams?
And they weren't so bad.
And over time,
you realized, "I like yams.
Yams are great."
Well, sometimes, Lynette,
people are like yams.
What'd you do?
Are you insane?
I was talking to her last night.
I-I mentioned we might need help,
and she volunteered.
You get it.
Tommy!
Mom!
Why couldn't she have been a yam?
We need directions to go to...
Okay, so this Tina...
was that the first
time he cheated on you?
Uh, I don't know.
You hear stories.
There was this thing
during the all-star game...
pictures of Doug in the tabloids
with a cocktail waitress.
But then he came back
with a Bulgarian bracelet,
so we never talked about it.
God, being married
to a pro athlete...
it must be a nightmare.
Well, sounds like you
are well rid of him.
You know, I feel like
you get me, Gaby.
And you know why? Because...
We're both extremely beautiful.
God bless you for having
the courage to say that.
Only someone who looks like us
can understand what
a burden it can be.
Actually, it's pretty awesome.
Oh, you know, sometimes
I drive fast on purpose
just to see if I can flirt
my way out of a ticket.
Amateur hour. Oh?
I got a bank manager to shave
a point off our mortgage
by bending over to
pick up a pencil.
To this day, Carlos calls
it my million-dollar ass.
Wait. I can top that.
Yesterday these babies
earned me a cool $8 million.
What do you mean?
Well, I wore a lut dress
to my settlement hearing,
and afterwards,
Doug's lawyer came to my hotel
to renegotiate.
You slept with him? You're awful.
I know.
I shouldn't have told you that.
Keep it to yourself.
Oh, honey, I won't tell anyone.
Um... I don't know
you well enough.
You've gotta give
me some dirt on you.
Hmm.
Huh.
I can't think of anything.
Really? Nothing?
Like, say... plastic surgery?
What?
Honey, a scalpel has
never touched this body.
Maybe not the body...
But that nose is a Dr. Brotski.
I'd know his work anywhere.
How dare you. I am insulted.
Okay, fine. I was 19.
It was just a little bump.
That's what they all say.
Did you have a
deviated septum, too?
Don't tell anyone. Carlos knows,
but if the girls find out,
I'd never hear the end of it.
Of course. You can trust me.
I'm beautiful.
That's true.
Good morning.
Good morning, sweetheart. Mwah.
Still not speaking to you.
Your breakfast will
be ready in a minute.
You want coffee. I'll get it.
Your scrambled eggs are ready.
Oh, mom, I was hoping
for your French toast.
She made you eggs, Tom. Eat them.
No, it's no problem.
You read your paper,
and I'll fix it right up, Rodney.
Uh, Tommy, mom.
Oh, didn't I say that?
Oh, it's just that you look
so much like your father.
Oh, gosh, what now?
Oh, let me get her.
It's what I'm here for.
Would you look at that?
My mother is on top of it,
and you get to sit and
have coffee with the man
that you kicked three times
"in your sleep" last night.
Look, I can take your
mother in small doses,
but her living here every day...
you know, I never got
what this thing is
you have with her.
I mean, you say you love her.
She's great with the kids.
'S your beef?
Okay, you really wanna
know what it is?
Yeah. Okay. I can't stand the
person she turns you into.
You become this Neanderthal...
Pfft. While she's tripping
over her apron strings
to serve you.
So she likes to dote on me,
and I don't mind the attention.
What's the big deal?
False alarm. She's fine.
Thank you.
Oh, and by the way...
More coffee. Yes.
Right away.
Just know if you ever
hold your coffee cup up to me,
you will be tapping
it with a stump.
Mike. I was gonna call you.
I was talking to Paul young.
He and the new missus are
really enjoying the house.
Are they?
Yeah, and Paul was wondering
if you would be interested
in selling the place.
He's willing to make a
very generous offer.
Lee, I never kicked your ass
for renting our house to that guy
'cause you didn't know our history,
but now you do.
So I gotta wonder,
are you an idiot?
I'm sorry. Paul wanted me to ask.
Susan and I are working
really hard to save money.
You tell Paul that the
day his lease is up,
we're moving home.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
I just ran into Mike.
Did you ask him about the house? Yeah.
He wasn't interested.
Did you tell him I'm willing
to pay above market value?
I could have, but I didn't
want to get punched.
You disappoint me, Lee.
There are other houses, Paul.
No. I need this one.
Fortunately, I have another
way to handle this.
Your deposit should clear Monday,
and this will be your balance.
Wait. This isn't right.
We should have a lot
more money in here.
Yes. The silver bracelet
that you cleaned last year
that belonged to my grandmother.
What do you think it's worth?
Okay. Um...
Yeah, I'll come by tomorrow.
Hi. Here's that gold
necklace you lent me.
What do you need it for?
You guys going on a fancy date?
No. I just, uh...
Just needed it back.
You okay?
You want to talk about something?
I can't.
Um... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna find you a tissue.
Susan, I was just at the bank.
We're missing $9,000 from
our checking account.
You went to the bank? Yeah.
What the hell's going on?
Did you take that money out?
Yes.
Susan?
Susan, what happened
to that money?
She lent it to me.
W-we had some bills
from Paige's birth
that weren't covered by insurance,
and Susan very kindly
offered to help us out.
That's right.
And she's gonna pay it
back by... by Friday.
With interest.
Or not... because,
I mean, we're friends,
so... why would you
charge us interest?
I gotta get back to work...
In case any of our other
friends need money.
Thank you so much.
You're so welcome.
Anything you wanna tell me?
Yeah.
But promise you won't yell?
You did porn on the Internet?!
No, it was just
cleaning in lingerie.
I... there... I was never naked.
There was no sex.
Well, unless the guys were
watching for cleaning tips,
it's porn. Susan!
How could you do this?!
Look, I feel bad enough already.
Well, you should! What if
Mike finds out? Or your kids?
Hey, it is really easy
for you to come down here
from your 5-bedroom house in
the suburbs and criticize me.
I am not on Wisteria Lane anymore.
Look at what Mike and I are
trying to climb out of!
We can't even afford hot
lunches for m.J. At school,
so just think about that
next time you wanna judge me.
Okay.
Done judging.
Back to being a friend.
I'm sorry you had to do that.
Me, too.
Doug, what are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Well, I'd invite you in,
but it's late and I hate you.
Baby, I flew all this way.
At least hear me out.
If it's about the settlement,
you're wasting your breath.
I miss you.
Well, how does Tina
feel about that?
That was a stupid mistake,
and it's over.
I know I screwed up...
Big this time.
Give me another chance.
I'm soy, Doug,
but I'm actually happy here.
I'm getting a fresh start,
making new friends.
Come on. Can't be happy
here in Mayberry.
You were made for Manhattan.
Oh, by the way. Cartier ed.
They miss you, too.
Oh, Doug, don't do this to me.
Think about everything
we had together.
I want it back.
Don't you?
Oh, I can't stop
thinking about that play.
What do you think the
angel represented
when he flew down in the
middle of the night?
I don't know. I was too
busy looking for the wires.
So, are you, uh,
in the mood for some dessert?
Totally.
I think the angel symbolized hope
or a-a second chance
at redemption, perhaps.
'Course, another
interpretation, I suppose,
could be...
oh, my.
When you said "dessert,
" I just assumed...
Well, there's no two
ways to interpret that.
Ohh! That was incredible.
Where did you learn to do that,
and why the hell am I asking?
Don't tell me. Mmm.
Oh, let's just say you inspire me.
Well, that'll teach me
to let you walk behind
me up the stairs.
What is that?
I guess inspiration struck again.
Please tell me you're
here to stab me.
What?
Nothing. Come on in.
What's that?
Aren't they supposed to
be sliced and peeled?
I'm too tired.
Please get that away from me.
I guess someone was
with Keith last night.
Were you once, twice,
three times not a lady?
It's not funny.
Six hours we had sex.
I feel like the Holland tunnel.
Honey, why don't you just tell him
you need a little break?
Because he's young. If I turn down
a roll in the hay,
he's gonna think I'm an old woman.
You just said "roll in the hay."
I think that ship has sailed.
Ohh! Well, I better figure
out how to slow him down
before this John Wayne walk
becomes permanent. Coming!
Come on in. Hey, girls.
Hey! Hey! You are just in time.
I mixed up a signature drink
in honor of your divorce.
I wouldn't pour that just yet.
I'm starting to rethink
this whole divorce thing.
Doug showed up last night.
He flew in from New York?
I know. He said
it's over with Tina.
Wants me back.
And he gave me this.
Oh, Doug screws up a lot,
but his apologies are
always the 4th of July.
Wow. Tom's apologies are
more like arbor day.
But he cheated on you.
Okay. A guy who has women
throwing themselves at him
in every city.
Meanwhile, we had ten great years,
and he loved me and cared
for me and I think I should
give him another chance.
Am I crazy?
Well, you have invested
ten years in the marriage.
No one goes that long without
a few bumps in the road.
Okay, then. I'm doing it.
Are you insane?
The man dumped you
for another woman.
Well, he apologized.
Can't I forgive him?
Why? Because he gave
you a stupid ring?
He's buying you off again.
Open your eyes.
Hey. It's my marriage anyway.
Why don't you just keep
your fake nose out of it?
What does she mean, fake?
Gabrielle Solis,
did you have a nose job?
Hello! We're talking
about Trampy McTrinket!
After all these years of you
bragging about your
natural beauty?
Oh, I never brag.
You once called your face
proof of God's existence.
You said I was a fraud for
wearing a padded swimsuit.
And now we find out you've
had plastic surgery.
Ooh! That changes everything.
No, it doesn't.
It wasn't plastic surgery.
It was corrective rhinoplasty
for a deviated...
You will regret this.
Oh, Gaby, come on! We're kidding!
Don't get your nose out of joint.
Bree Van De Kamp had a problem.
Her boyfriend's sexual appetite
was proving to be exhausting.
And then out of the blue,
Bree came up with a solution.
Since Keith's demands
were overwhelming her,
why not make some
overwhelming demands
of her own?
Wow. There's a lot of work here.
I guess I could get
it done by Friday.
Oh, no, I'm gonna need
it sooner than that.
Certainly... by tonight.
Hey, Allison made you
your favorite cookies for
your trip. Macaroons?!
Oatmeal raisin.
Oh. Those were my dad's favorites.
Maybe you can trade them with
the boy next to you on the plane
for his snack. Make fun,
but you have to admit,
she's been great with the baby.
She has been great.
You were right. I was wrong.
Oh, if only these were macaroons.
This would be the
best day of my life.
Call me when you land.
See you, babe.
Ah. So can I help
with the lasagna?
Actually, the boys said
they wanted meatloaf,
so I switched the menu. Now sit.
All right.
So Tom was telling me about
you going back to work.
I must say,
I don't understand that.
Well, that's...
Okay.
What are you doing?
I'm out of milk. Well, your
grandmother is not here to serve you.
I don't mind, dear.
See? She wants to.
Soda, gram? Make it two.
Boys!
Penny, I have to get the meat,
so you get the sodas.
Uh... why?
Why? We have to take
care of our men.
Penny, sit.
You boys want a drink,
get up and get it.
They had such a long day...
classes and then their
after-school sports.
Allison, in this house,
the women don't wait on the men.
The men get off their
asses and help themselves.
When did it become a sin to
take care of your family?
Oh, you modern women.
You just plop out a baby,
and then you can't wait to get
back to your silly careers.
I took care of my boys.
When my husband came home,
there was a hot meal waiting
for him on the table.
He never wanted for anything.
Yeah, and how did
that work out for you?
He had an affair and left.
Damn it.
I didn't realize you
were still here.
Have you been working
this whole time?
You said to get it all done today.
So if there is nothing else,
I would like to go home
and slip into a coma.
Why don't you spend
the night here?
I'd hate to see you
out there driving
when you're so exhausted.
You are exhausted, right?
Totally.
Every part of my body hurts.
Then stay.
Sleep here.
In the morning, I will make you...
Belgian waffles.
That will be my special thank you
for all of your hard work.
What are you doing?
I thought of another
way you could thank me.
You said every part
of your body was sore.
One part's doing okay.
Okay!
That's it! What's wrong?
I can't do it!
I can no longer keep up
with you and your Woody
woodpecker sex drive!
What? I-I'm just
gonna say it, okay?
I'm older than you.
I don't ha your stamina,
and I can't keep up.
You... you can't keep up?
I'm dating a woman who
talks to waiters in French
and wants to discuss a play's
symbolism during halftime.
Intermission. You see?
You're ten times smarter than me.
That's why I keep sexing you up.
I'm trying to keep you interested.
Make no mistake. I am interested.
I love when I am prattling on
about the meaning of the angel,
you notice the wires.
You have your own way
of seeing the world,
and it's fun and down-to-earth
and everything I'm not.
So you're saying you
like me how I am?
Wow. I hadn't thought of that.
Yes.
Very much.
Now put that thing away
and let's get some rest.
Hi. Who are you?
Oh, I'm Jenny. I'm the new nanny.
Ah! Isn't it great?
I offered her a little more money,
and she took the job.
She's the one with the boobs.
Remember?
Yeah.
You're welcome.
Lynette, can I... can I talk
to you upstairs for a minute?
Okay.
I'll be right up.
Oh. Okay.
So...
Great news about Jen, huh?
Yeah.
I just fired her.
What? You had no right to do that.
And you had no right
to make my mother feel
unwelcomed in my house.
She just wanted to be
a part of this family.
Tom, I love your mother,
and if this were 1955,
I would be so on board with
her parenting techniques,
but I will not let her raise our
children to turn out like...
Whoa, whoa. Finish that sentence.
T-turn out like me?
No. No, I didn't say that! I...
but we... let's be honest.
When we first met,
you thought there were
only two roles for women...
making a cake or
jumping out of one.
I'm sorry. I just don't want her here.
For our entire marriage,
you have been the one
to make the decisions.
"I'm going back to work."
"I'm hiring a nanny."
This time, I am making
the decision. She stays.
Okay, boys and girls, gather up
your supplies and put them away.
See you tomorrow.
Maxine, I can't talk now.
I'm at work.
Look, I know I fired you,
but if you like,
I'm willing to offer you,
uh, another chance.
Why?
Well, this guy keeps calling.
He really wants a private
session with you,
and he's starting to
offer some serious money.
Come on. What do you say?
How serious are we talking?
Thank you so much for coming.
I cannot tell you
what it means to me.
Yeah, yeah. Are you gonna
be singing any songs
about a woman who's a
backstabbing bitch?
We are really looking
forward to it, Emma.
Good luck. Thanks.
Would you get over it already?
Why don't we go sit down
with our friends? No!
I'm sick of Lynette making
those Cyrano de Bergerac jokes,
whoever she was.
He. And, baby,
they are just teasing you.
Well, it's not funny.
My thing was my natural beauty.
Like Susan's an artist.
Lynette's a great businesswoman.
Bree's the perfect homemaker.
I was the beautiful one.
Now I'm just the plastic one.
And there's the woman
who's to blame.
Man, I'd love to smack that
smile right off her face...
which, by the way,
has been pulled so tight,
it would probably smack me back.
I forgot what it was like
walking into a room on your arm.
I like it.
Baby, I think you are the
one they were staring at.
Ah. Well, this doesn't hurt.
Mmm. Mwah.
Hey, Gaby.
I didn't nose you'd be here.
Okay, I don't know what you heard,
but it's all crap.
Don't lie.
That'll make it grow again.
Tell Doug Perry it's on the house.
I'll do it.
It's on the house.
Oh, by the way,
she slept with your lawyer.
Enjoy the show.
Is that true?
Well...
The thing about that is...
Ladies and gentlemen,
the smokehouse lounge
is proud to present
Emma Graham.
Whoo, Emma!
A word. Aah!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Get the claws off the Versace!
Why the hell would
you tell him that?
Well, you know me and my big nose...
This is my marriage
we're talking about!
This trumps your stupid nose! O.
They're both fake!
Oh, what do you know?
You're nothing but a boring
housewife... shut up!
Whose life is so pathetic,
you gotta crap all over mine!
I'm pathetic?! Hey,
what do you call
a girl who sleeps with
a guy for $8 million?!
Get off! Uhh! Aah!
I'm gonna kill you!
You whore! Uhh! Get off me!
Okay, ladies, please.
Uhh!
I will never forgive you for this!
Sure you will. I'll just
buy you a sapphire ring.
Oh, you like my ring?
Well, get ready to smell I
oh, my God, my nose!
My nose! My nose!
Didn't think I'd
hear from you again.
Look, I've been thinking about
everything that's happened.
You slept with someone.
I slept with someone.
Maybe we should just call it even.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean, that's what
we both want, right?
Thank you, dear.
I am so sorry for saying those
things about your husband.
I appreciate that.
And I'm sorry if I...
Crossed some sort of line.
No.
It just felt so nice
to feel useful again.
You are useful,
and I really need you here,
especially when I go back to work.
You know,
the kitchen is my favorite
room in the house.
The family sits together here.
You get to cook for them
and make them happy.
And I just don't understand
why you would ever want to give
all that up to go out there.
It's just who I am.
Mom? The baby's crying.
Oh. Well, she's probably hungry.
Ooh. Yummy.
I'm so sorry.
What's your name again?
I'm penny.
And do you live here?
I'm not really used
to apologizing...
But here are some chocolates.
I haven't touched a carb since 1985,
but thank you.
Believe it or not,
I was actually on my way
over to apologize to you.
I don't know what came over me.
Look, I still feel you
deserve better than that guy.
But I had no right to screw with
your marriage. It's your life.
Doug called this morning.
He said he still wants me back...
Oh.
Wow.
And I said no.
Seriously?
He said we could pretend
it never happened,
and I thought of all the things
I pretended never
happened over the years.
You were right, Gaby.
I needed to open my eyes.
Okay, well, before I
take credit for this,
are you sure this
is what you want?
Yes.
And thank you.
Out of all the women,
you were the only one who had
the guts to tell me the truth.
You're a real friend,
and I'll take that over
a sapphire ring any day.
Oh!
You're keeping the ring,
right? Oh, hell, yeah.
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Are you shy, too?
Well, that's okay. So am I.
Why don't you start with just, uh,
telling me your name?
I think you know my name.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I'm still here, Susan.
Oh. Oh. Oh.
I'm glad you put your robe on.
I hate to see you
debasing yourself.
What do you want?
I'd like your house,
and I'm willing to pay a
very fair price for it.
Yeah, Mike told me about that.
It's not for sale.
Susan, it seems to me a lot
of things are for sale...
your body, your honor,
your reputation.
The house would seem to be
the smallest of those things.
Are you threatening me?
I'm simply saying it would
be terribly unfortunate
if anyone were to find
out what I already know.
I mean... I was shocked.
I can only imagine
what your husband
and son would think.
You son of a bitch.
It's a lot to take in, I know.
Why don't you take a couple
of days to think about it?
I'd hate for you to feel
that I was... pressuring you.
He knew what he was
doing was wrong.
He knew it was very dangerous.
He knew the risks
if people found out.
But Paul young wanted to punish
those who had betrayed him.
So he had a plan that would
set neighbor against neighbor
and friend against friend.
And it was a plan that
was going to succeed.

Previously on...
Bree's romance warmed up.
Oh, my.
You have no right to give
grace expensive gifts.
Gaby grew closer to her
biological daughter.
I want you to have it.
You deserve beautiful things.
Lynette finally got a nanny.
Tommy!
Mom!
But there was a catch.
Susan added to her
teaching income...
a secret job that
made her vulnerable...
Oh! Oh! It would be unfortunate
if anyone were to find
out what I already know.
To blackmail.
Imagine what your
husband would think.
Paul young was a frustrated man.
He'd been living with his
wife for over two months,
but she still refused
to sleep with him.
He tried everything
he could think of
to put her in the mood...
expensive jewelry...
Second glasses of wine...
Instructional videos.
But sadly,
his wife's response was
never what he'd hoped for.
So Paul decided to get help
from someone sure to sympathize
with his situation...
Hi. I'm Dr. Gable.
Another man.
Should we get this
session started?
So... when you married Paul,
it didn't occur to you he might
be released from prison someday?
Not really.
So you were content to marry a man
you could never truly be with?
I just wanted someone
to care about me.
I-I wasn't really interested
in all that other s-stuff.
"Stuff"?
Meaning sex?
Do you not like sex?
I'm not... sure exactly.
I'm a virgin.
Oh, come on!
It's true.
You're 30 years old!
I was saving myself for marriage.
Good news. You are married.
Time to take the lid
off the cookie jar.
Stop calling it that.
Give me a cookie, and I will!
Okay, okay, let's
take a step back here.
This is clearly an
unusual situation.
The two of you...
Never got to know each other
in any traditional sense.
My suggestion?
Start dating.
You want me to date my wife?
Yes. Court her. Take Beth out
to some nice restaurants.
Give her a chance to know you
so she can develop
normal romantic feelings.
In time, I'm sure
she'll want nothing more
than to share your bed.
I wouldn't mind going to
some nice restaurants.
Fine.
Yes, Paul young was frustrated.
But even frustrated men...
F.Y.I., until I get some action,
it'll be Dutch treat.
Have their pride.

It was that time of year
when people find out
what they're afraid of.
For some, it's the
monster in the bushes.
For others, it's the
spider in their hair.
For a few, it's the
vampire in the driveway.
Yes, Halloween had once
again come to Wisteria Lane.
And the only thing that
frightened one woman
was that she might not be
the center of attention.
I'm having a party,
and you all have to come.
Did you knock?
Doug and I had Halloween
parties every year in New York,
and I figured just because
I'm in Fairview now,
doesn't mean I can't
carry on the tradition...
Even though the food's not as good
and the company is...
Far less interesting.
Well, who would turn down
an invitation like that?
Well, grace is sleeping
over that night,
but we can swing by after
we're done trick-or-treating
and show you their costumes.
Juanita's going as a puppy this year.
She's gonna look so cute.
Yeah, see this?
The tricycle with a line through it?
What does that mean?
No kids.
They always get underfoot,
they eat all the candy,
and, uh, you can't swear in
front of the little bastards.
Well, I'll come if
I can bring Keith.
I guess one child will be okay.
I'm sorry to interrupt. Lynette?
Yeah?
Did you buy me my China
pearl hand cream?
I don't remember you asking me to.
But I guess I could go
after we're done eating.
Oh, all right. It's just
that my hands are so dry.
They're starting
to crack and bleed.
Uh... okay. I'll go now.
I'll see you guys later.
Just make sure that you
wake up Paige at 3:00,
'cause if she sleeps any longer,
she'll be up all night.
All right, dear. Okay.
Oh!
A party!
No.
As web sites go,
it's not that popular...
Just in Asia and parts of Europe.
And you can see that
there's no nudity.
I was just cleaning...
In my underwear.
Oh, look, Mike.
I know that you must be angry.
I-if you wanna yell, yell.
Let me have it.
Say something, please?
I should've taken
that job in Alaska.
What?
If I did a better job
taking care of this family,
you wouldn't have had
to resort to this.
No, no! This is not your fault!
It was my stupid mistake.
I thought I could make some easy
money and no one would know.
I'm so sorry.
Why'd you decide to tell me?
Did somebody see you?
Paul young.
Oh, God.
And he's... sort
of blackmailing me.
He said that if we don't
sell him our house,
he was gonna tell you.
But I told you,
so it doesn't matter.
And w-what are you doing?
What do you think?
No, no, no! Don't be angry.
This was good.
I'm not lying to you now.
When you think about it,
Paul did us a favor.
Look! No! No!
Look, look, look!
We're closer than ever.
Susan, get off me.
Violence isn't the answer.
We can't let him
get away with this.
We won't. I have an idea
how to get him to back off.
I'm listening.
I can't wait to go
trick-or-treating with you.
This is what I'm gonna
use to hold all my candy.
Uh, that's not going to
cut it in my neighborhood.
Last year, I filled
up two pillowcases.
Wow.
Where'd you get this?
Why?
This is my mom's.
No, it's not.
This was a gift... from my aunt.
Oh.
Okay.
Girls, come on.
Mrs. solis is here.
Hi, sweetie.
You and grace have a good time?
It was okay.
What are you smiling about?
I found out something
about grace today.
She's a thief.
What...
What are you doing with that?
She stole your necklace,
so I stole it back.
No! No! No!
I...
I mean... that's
very sweet of you,
but grace didn't steal this.
I gave it to her as a present.
Why?
Because... I felt sorry for her.
You know, her family is poor,
and we have so much.
Aunt Rosie's poor, and you
always hide your jewelry box
when she comes over.
Yeah, well, grace isn't a
klepto with a meth habit.
So do you want me to give it back?
No. I'll take care of it.
But now that I know you're
good at getting things back,
next time we're at aunt Rosie's,
I'm missing gold earrings.
Ah! Here you go.
Your China pearl hand cream.
Thank you, dear.
I just used my last jar.
You're welcome.
So how did it go with the baby?
And on a related note,
where is the baby?
Upstairs in the crib.
Oh. What?!
She's still asleep?
Yes, bless her heart.
I had time to mend all
of Rodney's old sweaters.
Tom's sweaters,
and I asked you, and you said
you would wake her at 3:00.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I would never agree to
wake a sleeping baby.
Oh, she's been down
for almost four hours.
Damn it. She's gonna
be up all night.
You stop yelling at me!
I'm not yelling at you. I'm...
Yes, you are!
You're angry and you're saying
it's my fault, and it isn't!
You're a liar!
Susan.
Hello. Um... What's this?
A peace offering.
A what?
Paul, we need to move past...
The past.
And you have been a
really good tenant,
and I appreciate that.
You never complain. You're
never late with the rent check.
In fact, you're usually early.
And who does that?
I'm just so lucky that...
Oh, dear.
What?
Is... is that a
thumbtack on the wall?
Well, I tried willing
the calendar to stay up,
but it just wouldn't cooperate.
Oh, but, Paul,
that's a clear violation
of your lease agreement,
which I happen to have...
Right here. Oh.
See? Page 2.
Strictly no alterations.
So...
It appears that you have 60
days to vacate the premises.
But good news.
I think you'll be getting
most of your deposit back.
I'll just need to deduct
the cost of repairing
the thumbtack hole.
Very clever, Susan,
but do you really think
you're in a position to
be making such demands?
Why don't we just agree
to overlook this
slight lease infraction
before I call your
husband and let him know
about his wife's
little cleaning fetish?
He knows, Paul.
I told him everything,
including the part where
you tried to blackmail me.
He wasn't happy.
See this?
This is what I had to
pry out of his hand
so you wouldn't need a paramedic
to pry it out of your skull.
Allow me to demonstrate.
This...
Is you.
This is you if you tell
anyone and Mike finds out.
I understand.
Don't forget. 60 days.
Oh! And enjoy those
raisin muffins.
At least, I hope
they're all raisins.
My apartment has rats.
I can't believe you're finally
gonna see my apartment.
Me neither, but as you said,
we need to get to know
each other better.
So...
Here goes.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?
Well, you have to understand.
I had this whole
frozen smile ready.
I was expecting a bachelor pad...
you know, pizza boxes,
dirty underwear,
neon beer clock.
But look at this place.
It's tastefully decorated
and smells...
Oh, my. Is that potpourri?
I just switched to the...
Autumn blend.
Take me... right now...
On the table.
Should I use a place mat?
Mmm. Mmm.
Hello.
That is Mimi, my roommate.
See ya.
Well, it looks like
that frozen smile came
in handy after all.
I have to say,
you do keep me on my toes.
This is an unexpected
spot for a first date.
Well, I know it sounds corny.
But you take a girl
to a haunted house,
and she'll probably
wanna grab onto you.
Hey, that pumpkin bread
looks pretty good.
Why don't you get us
a couple of slices?
Sure.
So... are you an Oakridge parent?
Oh, yes. We love the school.
Are you thinking of
sending your child there?
I don't think so.
My family values are
quite traditional.
I happened to hear
some information about
the after-school activities
of one of the teachers.
And let's just say...
It was troubling.
What kind of information?
Are you familiar with a,
um, Mrs. Delfino?
Ohh.
* Go to sleep, go to sleep *
* This is all grandma's fault *
* Go to sleep, go to sleep *
* Why can't she put
her things away? *
You okay?
What time is it?
12.
I'm sorry to wake you up,
but I am worried about your mom.
I don't think she's all there.
You woke me up at 4:00 A.M.
to bitch about my mom?
You couldn't do that
during business hours?
No. Listen. She sent me
out to buy hand cream
when she already had ten jars.
She forgot to wake up the baby.
She's older.
She forgets some things.
No! She also has these...
Intense mood swings.
I mean, today, she almost took
my head off for no reason.
Well, she's... and then...
and then she looked like she
was gonna burst into tears.
She's away from home.
She isn't used to all this chaos.
Okay. I get it.
She's your mom, and you love her,
and you can look for an excuse
for every one of these things.
But I think there's
more going on here
than just her being
a little forgetful.
Your light's on.
Hey, mom.
How you doing?
You okay?
Yes.
Why do you ask?
Is something wrong?
You just seem a little...
A little scattered lately.
H-have you noticed that?
There's my little worrywart.
Remember when you
were at Camp Kickapoo?
You were sure hurricane
Belle had killed us all
even though it was off
the coast of Georgia.
A-and that... that mean counselor
Bob wouldn't let me call you.
His name was Andy.
My God, you're right.
And you did call.
You even made me put
the dog on the phone.
Which you did.
No. I just barked
a couple of times.
Ruff ruff!
Sparky was asleep.
Oh, I better go get dressed.
I told Penny I'd help
her with her costume.
Okay.
Did you see that?
She's remembering things
that I don't even remember.
Yeah, but it's 9:00
in the morning, and...
And what?
I've been doing a little research,
and there is this thing
called sundowning.
A lot of people with dementia
don't show signs in the day.
It's only at night
that they get confused.
Did you not just hear her?
My mother is not senile.
Let's be honest.
You've been trying to get
her out of this house
ever since she walked in.
You think this is a tactic?
The other day, she made tea then
left the stove on for an hour.
There has been a lot
of stuff like that,
and I'm starting to get worried.
Maybe we should take
her to the doctor.
No!
Tom...
No!
Until we know what's going on,
I don't feel comfortable
with her watching the baby.
There is nothing wrong
with my mother, okay?
So just drop it!
Morning. Do you want
something to eat or some tea?
Oh. Tea would be lovely.
How do you take it?
With an explanation.
I'm sorry. Keith didn't tell me
that he had a female roommate.
And, yes, he said that you
two never slept together...
Well, except for those two times.
What?! We never had sex!
That's really what he said.
I just needed to see your reaction
to know that it was true.
Nicely done.
Thank you.
By the way, you don't need
to worry about other women.
The guy never stops
talking about you.
Oh, that's good to hear.
Well, I'm gonna grab a shower.
Here's your tea.
Water will be ready in a minute.
Oh, and, uh, when Keith wakes up,
could you just give
him his mail? Sure.
I know you didn't come to
deliver your R.S.V.P. in person.
What's up?
Well, I need to ask you something.
In the time that you and
Keith spent together,
did you ever have the
sense that he might be...
into bony old white ladies?
Definitely.
No, what I was wondering is,
have you ever gotten a vibe that
he might be a little... crazy?
Oh. Well, let me think.
Our first date was cut short
when you sabotaged your
own sprinkler system.
Our second was derailed
when you terrorized me
with a little person.
No, I think the vibe I
picked up is you're crazy.
Renee, you're not
being very helpful.
Fine. You wanna tell
me what this is about?
I'm trying to find out
if he's dangerous.
I recently discovered that he
is on probation for assault.
Oh. That?
You know about it?
Yeah. It happened at the
bar where I met him.
About a year ago,
he brought his girlfriend there.
Some guy started hitting on her,
so Keith flattened him.
Keith told you that?
No, the bartender did.
I always check out the guys
before I bring 'em home.
Don't wanna end up handcuffed
to my bed for three days...
Again.
So... Keith was defending
his girlfriend.
Well, it's nice to know
that chivalry isn't dead.
But there is another way to
find out if he's violent.
How?
Well, start a fight with him.
If he slugs you, he's violent.
Whoever left you handcuffed
to the bed for three days...
He has my respect.
Now, grace, this is the first
time I've made a costume,
so if you hate it, just tell me.
I love it.
I've never had such a
pretty costume before.
Thank you! You're the
coolest mom ever!
Look, mommy! Woof! Woof!
You're adorable!
Oh, grace.
You look beautiful.
Like a real princess.
I feel like one.
Ohh.
Well, you know what
every princess needs?
Look, I can also wag my tail.
Okay, hang on, sweetie.
Now once I put this on,
I'm gonna style your
hair around it. Okay.
Can you style my hair?
But, sweetie,
it doesn't even show.
But I am gonna go over
you with a lint roller.
I wanna be a princess.
What? All you've talked about
for the last four months
is how much you
wanted to go as a dog.
I changed my mind.
Well, I'm sorry.
You're either going as a dog
or a little Mexican girl.
And in this neighborhood,
we both know which one's
getting more candy.
Let's go to the mirror,
sweetie. Okay. Okay.
So your pumpkin can have a
happy face or a scary face.
Ms. Delfino?
Principal Hobson would
like to see you.
He seems upset about something.
There you are.
Your son's been waiting
four million years
to go trick-or-treating.
Me want candy. Ugh!
Ohh. Okay, sweetie.
Why don't you go get your
tennis shoes on and we'll go?
What's with the box?
You okay?
I got fired.
What?
They found out about the web site.
Paul!
This time, I'm gonna kill him,
and you're not stopping me.
Mike, no. It... it wasn't him.
One of the moms called the school,
probably caught her husband
watching it or something.
So what are we gonna do?
We can't make it on
what I'm bringing in.
I'll find another job.
I'll...
You'll what?
What are you doing?
I'm calling Tommy Glenn in Alaska.
He said whenever I was ready...
No Alaska.
You'll be gone three months.
You can't do that to M.J.
Do what? Make an honest living?
How much thought did you give M.J.
when you were dancing
around in your underwear?
Please don't say that.
And now one of the moms
at the school knows,
so there's a pretty good chance
he's gonna hear about it.
No, Susan, you don't get
to make the decisions
about what's best for
this family anymore. I do.
Take M.J. trick-or-treating.
I'm gonna make this phone call.
I had a lovely time
at dinner tonight.
It was nice to hear all those
stories about your childhood.
It was nice telling them.
Those were happy days.
I liked remembering them.
Can I give you an odd compliment?
When you talk about the past,
it changes how you look.
You're not so...
Intimidating.
Well, that is an odd compliment.
But I... appreciate it.
W-w-what are you doing?
I was responding to what I
thought was a signal from you.
I wasn't signaling for you
to try to jam your
tongue down my throat.
Beth, I'm not some kind of animal
trying to satisfy its urges.
If I was,
I could've gone to a bar or any
street corner weeks ago.
Then what do you want?
I wanna connect with you,
to have a real marriage.
And, yes, sex is part of that.
But there's more.
With what I've been through,
I need a partner by my side,
someone that I can trust.
I think you can be that person.
The question is...
Do you?
I want you gone by
the end of the week.
Trick or treat! Trick or treat!
Trick or treat! Come on!
Trick or treat!
Oh, here you go!
Happy Halloween!
Welcome! Welcome!
Renee, I love your costume.
Who are you supposed to be?
Ah.
* Happy birthday to you *
* Happy birthday to you *
* Happy birthday, Mr. President *
Michelle Obama. Cool.
Clearly, he's come as
one of hell's idiots.
Oh, it looks like we're
gonna run out of candy.
I think I'd better
head to the store.
No, we are veterans at
the candy game, mom.
We got loads of backup
in the cupboard. Mmm.
Plus I always keep a
stash in my golf bag.
Oh, you and your sweet tooth.
Oh! Oh! More customers!
Don't forget to say "thank you."
And, Celia, stop mooing.
You're a cat, remember?
Trick or treat!
Oh! How precious!
You're Tom's mother, right? I'm Gaby.
We met the other day.
Of course. Uh, this must be
your beautiful little princess.
You're as pretty as your mommy,
aren't you?
No. No. My daughter's a dog.
The dog. That dog.
Oh.
It's cheaper than therapy.
Oh, dear. We're
running out of candy.
I should take a little
walk to the store.
I think we have more somewhere.
Don't you worry.
Grandma's gonna take care of it.
* Happy birth... *
Son of a bitch.
Hey...
Thanks for cheering for me
at the big game today, huh?
My pleasure. Go team.
And, uh, since I scored
the winning touchdown,
don't I get a kiss or something?
Oh, I'm afraid not.
I'm already going to the
prom with someone else.
Oh. So? He doesn't have to know.
Come on. One kiss.
All right,
our little skit is over.
Hey, you're not getting
rid of me that easy.
Really. Keith!
Could you come here for a second?
Hey, you guys look great together.
Well, I was actually just
asking this gentleman
to leave me alone, but he
doesn't seem to be getting it.
That true? You bothering her?
No. It's the costume thing.
We were just fooling around.
Thank you. That was very gallant,
not to mention sexy.
Hmm.
You know, no one has ever
defended me like that before.
Orson once threw half
a diet soda at a man,
but we were in a moving vehicle,
so I don't...
Keith?
Oh, dear.
Look, like I said,
I was just having some fun.
By being a jackass?
You need to apologize
to my girlfriend.
Fine. Sorry.
Apology accepted. Let's go.
Hold on a second.
Try that again,
and this time, mean it.
Or you'll do what?
Keith, please, stop, stop.
Hey! Hey!
Keith!
Keith!
Keith! What happened in there?
An idiot pushed my buttons,
and I went off!
Wasn't it obvious?!
Well, why are you yelling at me?
Because it's who I am!
I've been arrested
for this before!
You know, I kept trying
to convince myself
that it wasn't a problem
until the second time
that I got arrested,
then I realized it was.
So feel free to break up with me
'cause you know you want to.
I don't want to break up with you.
Come on. You can't be
with a guy like me,
not the way that you are
with your controlled smile
and your perfect house
and your perfect lawn.
You wanna talk about
my perfect lawn?
Nine years ago, my son found
me facedown drunk on it.
It's true!
He had turn the sprinklers
on to wake me up.
Did you not know you were dating
the biggest lush in Fairview?
No, I didn't.
We all have baggage,
and you and I have
reached that point
where we get to see
what the other's
been carrying around
all these years.
Anything else you've been hiding?
No. You've pretty much
seen me at my worst.
Well, I don't think I've seen
anything that I can't handle.
How about you?
You think you can deal
with a control freak
with a drinking problem?
Ooh! And there goes the thumb.
Yeah, so much for hitchhiking.
Oh. Hey, mom, you got that?
Grandma's not back yet.
Back from where?
She walked to the store
to get more candy.
What?
Hey, guys, will you, uh,
listen for the baby?
I will, uh,
be back as soon as I can.
Is grandma okay?
She's, uh...
Yeah, it's just a little late
for her to be out by herself.
I'll be... I'll be right back.
Wow! I can't believe
I got so much candy!
You deserve every piece, grace.
You worked that sidewalk
like a Milan runway.
How did you get so much
of this in your fur?
This is why cats do not chew gum.
Here, you said you
liked peppermint.
Aw. That is so thoughtful.
Thank you.
Ohh! Okay.
I've gotta give Celia a bath.
You two go easy on the candy.
Oh, gosh. I can't get
this out of my hair.
Mrs. Solis?
Oh, that's all right.
We don't need her.
I'll take care of it.
Okay, let's try
this one more time.
What does a cat say?
Oink?
Boy, I really hope you marry well.
She was having a problem.
I fixed it.
Really? You're not
just saying that?
No, Lee, you are a much
prettier Marilyn than she is.
J.F.K. would be all over that.
Hmm.
Oh, hang on.
Oh, hey, Carlos. What's up?
Oh, I... O-okay. I will be...
I will be right there.
Shoot.
It's me.
Lynette?
Yeah.
Oh! Thank God.
Oh, it's all right.
It's gonna be all right.
I was walking. I-I-I must
have got turned around.
I made it up...
up to Claire Graham's place,
but... the lights were out.
There is no Claire
Graham on this street.
Oh, there most certainly is.
She... lives...
Oh. Let's just...
Let's go home.
You let go of me!
You're doing this to me.
You're making me feel crazy.
Oh, Allison...
I said let go!
Ohh!
I'm so sorry, dear. Uh...
I don't know where my head is.
I've never done that... before.
Tell her, Tommy.
It's okay, mom.
I'm here.
Mama, that is what he said.
"I want you gone."
Those were his exact word.
I am. I-I am tring to
make it work, I swear.
I do everything he asks of me.
Maybe I should come home.
But, yes, I know I
made a commitment,
but I am so unhappy.
Of course I want you
to be proud of me.
Okay. Uh...
I-I-I-I will.
I'll try.
Bye, mama.
Susan! Hang on.
I need to talk to you.
Ow, ow, ow. Stiletto heels,
why do you hate me?
What's up?
Paul young wanted me to ask
again if you had any interest
in selling your place.
No. He knows that.
In fact, he's vacating
our house in 60 days.
Well, he insisted I check again.
He said your circumstances
had recently changed, and...
Wait. When did he say that,
exactly?
This morning.
Can you take M.J.
to Mrs. McCluskey's for me?
Sure.
Sweetie, mommy's gonna
hold that for you.
Susan.
You bastard!
Susan, what the
hell are you doing?
When you moved here,
I tried to give you the
benefit of the doubt!
But you're evil!
Well, guess what?
Benefit of the doubt is over!
Trick or treat!
He's out of candy!
You know what?
I'm glad I didn't
let Mike do this.
'Cause I'm really enjoying it!
Get away from him.
Beth, you don't
know what he's done.
I don't care.
He's my husband.
Now get out of this house.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Well, I hope you're happy.
Mrs. Sanchez was furious
when she saw what you
did to grace's hair.
Fortunately,
that sweet little girl
saw I was in a jam and said it
was her idea. Of course she did.
Well, thank God.
Otherwise, she wouldn't be able
to come here and play anymore.
Who cares?
Honey, grace is your friend.
I didn't even know
her till a month ago.
But you love spending
time with her.
No, you do.
You're always talking to her,
kissing her,
staring at her.
You like her better than me.
Oh, that's ridiculous!
Then why did you give
her that necklace?
You don't even let me
touch your jewelry.
What's so special about grace?
Whatever.
This is bad.
She knows something is up.
I think we should pull back,
stay away from grace for a while.
No! No way. No, no, no.
I'll just be more careful.
It'll be fine.
Gaby, we have to
protect our daughter.
They're both our daughters.
I really don't want you to go.
I don't wanna go either,
but this will make us enough money
to get Paul out of our house
and give us our lives back.
Plus if I stay,
I'm afraid I'll kill him.
Okay. Car's loaded.
It's time to go.
To the nursing home.
Mom, again,
it isn't a nursing home.
It's assisted living. It's...
It's a beautiful facility with...
with flower beds
and activities and lots
of other people. It's...
Just tell me this, Tommy.
After I go there,
when do I get to leave?
When do I get to go home?
We'll have to see
what the doctors say.
Never, that's when.
I've seen my friends
go into these places,
and they don't come back.
Mom...
I talked to Peter and Theresa,
and we all agree.
You can't live by
yourself anymore.
If something bad were
to happen to you,
we would never...
Forgive ourselves.
The only thing bad happening here
is what you're doing to me.
Mom... I don't know
what else to do.
When you called me at that camp
and you were scared,
you kept saying,
"I want to come home, mom."
And I said, "Tommy,
if you mean that,
I'll come get you."
That's what you do.
The time comes when
we all must find out
what we're afraid of.
Some of us fear...
"She may never forgive me."
Others worry...
"She might learn the truth."
A few wonder...
"Could he send me away?"
Yes. The world is a scary place.
It's even more terrifying...
If we have to face it...
Alone.
Sync by YYeTs.
Previously on...
I really don't want you to go.
This will make us enough money
to get Paul out of our house.
Mike took a job in Alaska.
I'm trying to treat you like a lady.
Bree's new romance got serious.
So you're saying you like me how I am.
Very much.
Paul's bride pushed him
to the breaking point.
I want you gone by the end of the week.
But she was strongly encouraged...
Bye, mama.
To save her marriage.
Humiliation...
it's something we all try to avoid...
whenever possible.
But unfortunately,
there are some days when
we can't help but fall...
flat on our face.
You okay?
I'm fine! Mortified, but... Whew! Fine.
What happened?
I don't know. I was...
thinking about how hot it was,
and I didn't pay attention
to where I was going.
Oh. For a second there,
I was wondering if you fell on purpose.
On purpose?
A broken leg would be a great excuse
to get out of dinner with my parents.
Don't be silly. I'm looking
forward to meeting your parents.
Can we sit for a minute?
The heat is really starting to get to me.
Really? It's not that hot.
Are you kidding? It feels like...
someone turned on a furnace!
Are you okay? Have I been
pushing you too hard?
No, no! I'm having the time of my life.
Whew. I just need
to rest for a tiny little...
So what happened?
I'm not exactly sure.
She probably just overexerted herself.
This is beyond embarrassing.
There's a lemonade stand over there.
Should I get her something to drink?
Good idea. She might be dehydrated.
This is ridiculous.
I had a bottle of water an hour ago.
And I did not overexert myself.
I happen to be in very good shape.
Your heart rate is a bit elevated.
Well, probably from the stress
of having all these strangers gawk at me.
Oh, my lord.
It's happening again. Do you see this?
It's like a wave of heat just...
coursing through my body.
What is happening to me?
Am I having a stroke?
Honey, you're just having a hot flash.
A what?
Yeah, it's no big deal.
We all have to go through
the change sometime.
Wait, are you saying...
Yep. You've started menopause.
Humiliation...
So did we figure out what was wrong?
It's something we all try to avoid.
It's no big deal. She just had...
Indigestion.
I never should've let you
buy me that hot dog.
Especially women who date...
younger men.
It was morning in suburbia...
a time for women to attend
to their husbands' needs.
And while Tom Scavo's wife was
setting out the sports section,
and Carlos Solis' wife was
removing lint from his suit...
and Roy Bender's wife was
cleaning his dentures...
Paul Young's wife was resting
because she had already attended
to her husband's needs...
all night long.
Thank you.
For what?
For the most amazing night.
So I didn't disappoint you?
Are you kidding?
I'm so glad.
I must say, for a virgin,
you were certainly open-minded.
My whole life,
I heard people talk about sex.
They always made such a big deal about it.
And don't get me wrong,
it was very interesting.
But lying here quietly...
this is my favorite part.
It's wonderful, isn't it?
So would you like to do it again?
I hear that men like sex in the morning.
I must say, so far,
your research is flawless.
Beth, I'm gonna need a rain check.
Why?
I have business to attend to.
Who is that man?
Derek Yeager, my cellmate from prison.
So have you thought about my offer?
I have.
I actually think starting
an interior design business
is... interesting.
Interesting? It's... it's genius.
You know what an artistic eye I have.
Oh, my God. Oh, are you doing
what I think you're doing?
If you think I'm trying to stuff
my boob in my daughter's mouth,
then yes.
Ugh. It's so unnatural.
So...
What do you say? Mm.
I will woo the clients,
be the face of the company,
uh, while you do all the business-y stuff.
It would be nice to be my own boss.
Okay.
I'm in. And if we work out of your place,
I can bring the baby with me.
Ooh, well, that... won't work.
Everything at my place is metal and sharp.
No, it isn't.
Well,
then I'll have metal and
sharp things brought in.
No babies in my house.
Well, then we'll have to work here.
Right.
Potential clients will be so impressed
when they walk into this...
tipped-over hamper.
Get a nanny.
I've been trying.
It's not that easy.
Well, then I'll find someone.
Mm, there's gotta be some
poor schlub out there
who's trustworthy and desperate for money.
I don't like this kind.
Oh, honey, it's cheaper.
But it doesn't have a prize.
The prize that comes with this cereal
is we can afford the milk.
Okay, that's $61.48.
Even with all the coupons?
Well...
nothing in there.
Let me see if I can put
something back. Uh...
My fabric doesn't have to be that soft.
And hey.
Meat is murder, right?
Okay, you know, just put $20 on this
and I'll pay the rest in cash.
Care to donate a dollar
to St. Matthew's kids?
What?
It's for poor people.
You give a dollar, I ring the bell,
everyone knows you donated.
Has that piercing affected your sight?
I'm counting pennies here.
Lady, we're supposed to ask everyone.
Calm down.
"Calm down"?
Yeah, I can't afford to buy
my kid the cereal he likes.
He's gotta eat this cardboard crap.
Ooh! Nickel in the swear jar!
And that used to be
a quarter in the swear jar.
We've even had to mark down our swears.
So don't talk to me about
the poor 'cause I am the poor!
Where's my little jar
at the checkout stand?!
There is none!
Don't feel bad. She screamed
at our dry cleaners, too.
Your burnt the meat loaf again?
It's just a little crispy. It'll be fine.
And what's with the candles
and the good China?
Is it our anniversary?
Ow! Why are you hitting me?
Because you don't listen to me.
I told you last night
Bob was coming for dinner.
Oh, right.
Bob.
What was that for?
Not knowing when our anniversary is.
Okay. When is it?
I don't have time for this!
Bob is gonna be here any second.
Do I have to eat with you guys?
Bob and I have nothing in common.
I'm sorry he's not all...
"See the game last night?"
C"heck out the jugs on her.
Hey, pull my finger!"
I did that one time.
At my cousin's funeral!
You're right.
I am unfit to socialize
with your classy gay boyfriend.
I should be forced to eat by myself...
in front of the game.
No. You are having dinner with Bob,
and that is all there is to it!
For God sakes, he helped us
find our biological daughter.
We owe him more than we can ever repay.
Then shouldn't we take him out
for a nice meal
instead of forcing him to eat
that briquette you call meat loaf?
I hope the pot roast isn't too dry.
It's good.
He's an ex-con. He's just happy
there's no ground glass in it.
It must be nice for you two
to see each other again.
Uh, how long were you roommates?
Cellmates. Yeager and I
spent two years together.
We kind of... looked out for each other.
That's lovely.
If I may ask, Yeager, what were you, uh...
I believe the phrase is "in for"?
Well, you know, uh,
sometimes when people steal stuff...
they give it to another guy
who sells it for 'em.
Yes. A "fence."
Right.
I killed a fence.
Oh.
Well, how about that?
Uh, we may wanna keep
that story to ourselves.
I'm sure the people on the Lane
would be unsettled to learn that
their new neighbor was a convicted murderer.
Neighbor?
Yes.
Yeager's going to be staying
at my old house for a while.
He's doing a little work for me.
What kind of work?
It's nothing you need to worry about.
I'm not worried about it. I just wanna know.
Darling, I'm not trying to exclude you.
I'm trying to protect you.
From what?
Beth, let's enjoy our dinner.
We have a guest.
Ah. And this was Grace at Halloween.
Oh, she's beautiful, Gaby.
And so sweet.
Getting to know her
has been such a blessing.
Carlos and I will never be
able to thank you enough.
Hey, I just made some calls.
No, you did more than that.
You changed our lives.
Oh.
So...
We wanted to give you these...
as a token of our appreciation.
Orchestra seats to... "Cats."
What's wrong? I thought you love musicals.
That was Lee. He was the show queen.
When I found out he saw "Annie" six times,
even I wanted to gay bash him.
Oh. Okay, well, I wanna get
you tickets to something.
Do you like the opera?
Figure skating?
Beauty pageants?
Barbra?
Sorry.
Ever think the reason Lee broke up
with you is you're not gay?
Hey, what can I say?
Give me a beer and
a college basketball game,
I'm happy.
You're kidding. Who you like this year?
Well, Duke's got most of its starters
coming back this year, so...
Hey, hey, hey!
You kiss boys with that mouth?
Bob, I get basketball tickets all the time.
You wanna go to a game this week?
Are you serious?
Oh, I'm in. You know,
there's a game on tonight.
Maybe after dessert, we can turn on...
What's wrong?
I thought I knew you.
Now all of a sudden,
you're talkin' beer and basketball?
It's like you're not even a...
a tired gay stereotype?
Exactly. It's very upsetting.
Tell you what, let us watch the game.
During halftime,
I'll come back in and tell you
how great you look
in your Dolce & Gabbana.
Versace.
Just go. I can't even look at you right now.
Menopause? You're not old enough
to be going through menopause.
And more importantly, I'm not old enough
to have a friend going through menopause.
This has completely blindsided me.
These last few weeks being with Keith,
I have felt so alive.
Even when I was young,
I didn't feel this young. But now...
Oh, I hate to spoil the announcement of
your death sentence, but life does go on.
And there is an upside. I'd love to skip
those three days a month when
I'm cranky and irritable.
Just three days, huh?
This couldn't have come at a worse time.
I'm sure it'll be the end of
my relationship with Keith.
Why do you say that?
Oh, here's why... "check out my girlfriend,"
"the one with the pit stains
and the estrogen patch."
Exactly. Now he'll be looking
for some fresh, young thing
who doesn't retain water and
can still bear him children.
So why tell him?
I have to. We're in a relationship.
Where'd you get that?
"The big book of staying single"?
There is no reason you
have to tell your boyfriend
the absolute truth about yourself.
Yeah, we lie to men all the time.
I don't.
Oh, please. You're telling me
you never pretended you like football?
Mm, or laughed at a three stooges movie?
Or faked an orgasm just to make him stop?
Hey, just for the record,
I love football, stooges are damn funny,
and I've never asked a man to stop.
Interesting.
Susan? Renee Perry here.
Listen, Lynette and I are starting
a fabulous interior design business.
Anyway, I hear you've got
some time on your hands,
and we could really use your help.
The pay's good, and the hours are flexible.
Now we're at Lynette's if you're interested.
What just happened?
Oh! Your mommy just got
a job as an interior designer!
With that ash.
Susan!
I came over as soon as
I got Renee's message.
Oh, I would love to help you guys out.
But...
I told her about the job.
Renee...
Oh, why not?
She's obviously flat broke.
No one lives downwind
from a pet store by choice.
It's true. I need to work.
Well, obviously, you're more than qualified,
but are you sure it won't be weird?
I mean, we're friends.
Oh, I think that's a plus.
I just wanna make sure that...
Oh, for God sake,
the woman wants to be your nanny.
Hire her.
Excuse me for not wanting to ruin
one of my closest friendships.
You didn't worry that working
together would ruin our friendship.
Go figure.
Well, if you're cool with this,
I would love you to start right away.
What do you think?
I-I think my dear friend
just offered me a job.
How could I say no?
Mrs. Van De Kamp?
Hi. I'm Dr. Wagner.
Oh. Um, I usually see Dr. Shapiro.
She's on maternity leave.
Oh. Well, there's some salt in the wound.
Yes, so I see you're here
to talk about menopause.
And frankly, you're in luck.
In addition to being a
gynecologist for 20 years,
I am going through the change myself.
Is it awful?
The way I look at it, we've earned this.
It's like getting a watch when
you retire from a job well done.
I suppose, but still,
I was hoping you could give me
something to mask the symptoms.
See, I'm recently divorced,
and I'm dating someone
who is significantly younger than me.
I understand.
And might I add, check you out!
Well, I must say,
I highly recommend
the younger man experience.
The stamina can be quite invigorating.
I've heard tell.
And in the interest of keeping
this going as long as possible,
I am prepared to... lie.
So do you think you can help me
put menopause on pause?
I think so. We have a duty
as woman of a certain age
to keep this sizzling relationship going.
So let's talk about some therapies.
Hey! I was in the neighborhood and thought,
you know who I haven't seen lately? Gaby.
Okay.
I'd love to catch up, but it's 11:00,
and I was about to go to...
So how are things?
Love the highlights.
You totally make those shoes work.
They're slippers.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So that was fun.
Hey, talked to Bob lately?
Anything new going on with Bob?
I don't think so.
Don't cover for him. He's seeing someone.
What makes you say that?
Jason told Hunter
who told Sergio who told me
that Bob has been seen out
three times with some hunky Latino.
No, no, no. Bob's not seeing anyone.
Oh, fine. Then I will go tell Hunter
to tell Sergio to tell
Jason that he's a liar.
No. No, no, no, no.
The hunky Latino is Carlos.
He and Bob have been hanging out.
What?
Yeah. So you have nothing to worry about.
No, no. That... that means we both
have something to worry about.
Huh?
Look, I hate to break it to you,
but Bob's always had
a major crush on Carlos.
What? I hate to break it to Bob,
but Carlos is as straight as they come.
So was Bob's college roommate
and his thesis advisor
and his basketball coach!
Oh, that's why he likes basketball.
Bob's college nickname was "flipper,"
and it wasn't because of his dolphin tattoo.
Okay, this is crazy.
Bob isn't going to "flip" Carlos.
Okay, let me... let me tell you his game.
First, he takes them out drinking,
then he gets them really hammered.
Then, when their defenses are down,
he flips 'em.
Well, I mean, not literally...
Yeah, actually, sometimes literally.
Um, Lee, I think I know my husband.
He's not passing up these chimichangas
for a plate of Franks and Beans.
Okay, I don't... I don't
know what that means,
but you just ruined Mexican food for me.
Oh, my God. I can't let Bob
see me like this.
Well, use the back door.
I always do.
Hey!
Where you guys been?
The game ended hours ago.
We went out to a bar.
He kept buying me drinks. I'm so hammered.
So I've come up with a marketing plan
and a billing structure.
Oh, and I filed for a license with the city
so we can get a discount...
with our suppliers.
Are you listening to me?
I'm sorry. That was so dull,
I actually started to dream.
Hey! How's it going?
Oh. Fine. Paige is asleep.
That quickly?
What's your secret? Whiskey?
I'm not judging. I just wanna know.
No, just rocked her.
Hey, have you heard from Mike? How's Alaska?
Uh, he's fine. Thanks for asking.
Did you guys know
that the state of Rhode island
can fit into Alaska 424 times?
Read that once on a cup. Never forgot it.
When we're wooing clients,
let me do the talking.
So, uh, since I'm not busy,
where do you keep your dirty laundry?
Oh. Honey, you don't have to do the laundry.
Sit down. I'll open some wine.
No, thanks. I'm on the clock.
I'd rather get work done.
Well, if you're looking for something to do,
I'd love some more iced tea.
Renee, that is not her job.
That is her job.
Susan, I didn't mean you needed...
You're right. This is my job.
I don't know what to do, mama.
He won't tell me why
he's trying to buy all these houses.
And now he's got a murderer
moving into one of them.
Hold on.
I've got an idea.
Well, hello there.
Paul went to the store.
Will he be gone for a while?
Yeah.
It sure is a mess in here.
Can't help but wonder
what you boys are up to.
You wanna know what's going on?
Talk to your husband.
You saw me. I tried.
He's keeping me in the dark for some reason.
That's between you and him.
You want to keep his confidence.
I get that.
But, please... I'm just so worried.
Lady, I'm not comfortable
with you gettin' this close.
Why?
Oh!
You're a parolee.
You can't afford to get
in any trouble, can you?
That's right.
If you got accused of a crime,
they might lock you up for good.
Huh?
What are you doing?
When I tell people you attacked me,
I want it to look realistic.
What the hell? I never
hurt a woman in my life!
You think the police are
gonna care about that?
You're a convicted felon.
You can't be doing this.
I already got two strikes.
I don't like to be unpleasant, Mr. Yeager.
Really, I don't.
But I am going to find out
what my husband is up to,
one way or the other.
Hey, hon.
We have to take the girls
shoe shopping this weekend.
What's better for you, Saturday or Sunday?
Neither. I'm going to
rancho pines for the weekend.
Or you're gonna play golf?
This sounds like fun.
Yeah. Bob invited me.
Bob? You're going with Bob?
Uh-huh. He got us a suite at the lodge.
Oh. So this is a-a sleepover?
Well, it's a 6:00 A.M. tee time.
Bob says that'll be a lot easier.
I bet he did.
But why not get your own room?
Bob says he got the last one available.
Wow, you're just trustin' Bob
left and right, aren't ya?
What do you mean?
I'm just surprised, that's all.
One week, we hate the gays.
The next week, we let 'em watch us shower.
It's kinda kooky, don't you think?
What the hell are you talking about?
Oh, open your eyes!
This trip is not about golf for Bob.
It is about... seduction!
Really? That's great,
'cause I was actually planning
on turning gay this weekend.
Don't joke like that.
Can't you tell I'm upset?
I can, but I don't know why.
Even if Bob wanted to seduce me,
which I doubt,
do you really think I'd go along with it?
Well, no.
Then why does this bother you so much?
I don't know! It just does!
Fine. I won't go.
Really?
Oh. Thank you.
I certainly wouldn't want to do anything
that makes you think I'm gay.
In that case, ditch the moisturizer.
Oh, I really hope your parents like me.
Relax. I already laid the groundwork.
I told them you were smart and beautiful
and a terrific cook. Thank you.
And what did they say
about the age difference?
Nothing. I didn't tell them.
What? Why?
Because you look so fantastic...
I don't even think they're gonna notice.
But I don't want them to think
we're trying to put one over on them.
Here we go.
Dad, mom, I'd like you to meet Bree.
Well, hi. I'm Richard.
This is my wife Mary.
Well...
Check you out.
Bree,
Keith tells us you're a professional chef.
I was. Now I just cook for fun.
Oh. Me, I'm retired from the army.
So as long as it doesn't come in a can,
it tastes good to me.
Oh, a military man. You must
have some fascinating stories.
Ah, no. Mary's the one with the stories.
Guess what she does for a living.
Yes, take a wild guess.
She's a doctor.
As matter of fact,
I have a brand-new, incredible work story.
Would you like to hear it?
No. No, because I realize that as a doctor,
you're prevented ethically
from talking about your... patients.
Depends how drunk I am.
So the army...
Can I just thank you
for keeping our country safe?
Let's talk about you, Bree.
I don't know if you realize this,
but you are
the first girlfriend that Keith
has introduced to us to...
Mm.
So you must be very special.
Yes. Keith, it seems serious.
I mean, is... is Bree the one
who's gonna be giving me my grandchildren?
Mom...
Huh?
Ignore Mary. No, no, no, ignore Mary.
I...
Grandchildren are her big thing.
Well, no, I just think
that when you reach
this point in a relationship,
it's something you should talk about.
Well, there's plenty of time for that.
No, not as much as you may think. Waiter!
Mary!
Stop it. I think you're embarrassing Bree.
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
It's just a little... warm in here.
Are you sure? 'Cause this is
exactly what happened to you
at the park the other day.
Mom, could you take a look at her?
Of course.
Bree, why don't you tell me your symptoms?
Honestly, it's nothing.
I just get a little warm sometimes.
Would you say that
the sensation comes on suddenly,
like a...
like a flash of hotness?
No. Not at all.
Let's just... drop it.
Well, you seem so irritated.
Before, you were so pleasant.
Would you say that your moods
swing suddenly like this?
What are you doing? Stop badgering.
I just...
I'm not badgering. I'm simply
asking her to tell the truth.
Is... is that something
that's also difficult
for you these days, Bree?
Telling the truth?
Oh, for God sake!
I am going through menopause, okay?!
That is what Dr. Wagner is
so delicately trying to say.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I am going to the kitchen
to ask them if I can stand
in their walk-in freezer!
Guess what else?
That's not her real hair color either.
Okay.
Sorry.
We should get going, Barbara.
We have a 7:00 reservation.
And we have a whole presentation for you
after dessert.
Oh, I don't know if I can wait that long.
Can I have a sneak peek?
Um...
Sure.
This is for your daughter's room.
Uh, we were thinking
all the furniture in an antique white,
and, uh, pale rose for the walls.
It's both elegant and feminine.
You don't feel it might be
a little old for her?
She's only 7.
Oh, no. No, trust me.
This color works for all ages.
It's a... it's a classic look.
Mm.
Or...
just an idea, but maybe
you could do something more playful.
I painted the characters
from the knights of the round table
in my son's room, and he loved it.
And maybe you daughter
has a favorite character
from a-a-a movie or a book?
I'm sorry. We haven't been introduced.
I'm Barbara Fine.
Uh, this is Susan Delfino.
The nanny.
Well, Susan, it's a great idea.
I'm gonna call my daughter
and see if there are
any characters that she would love
to see on her wall.
You should show her
your other sketches. She's good.
What the hell was that?
Uh, it... it was just a thought.
I think she liked it.
I don't care! You made us look like idiots.
That was not my intention.
Regardless, I do not
appreciate being upstaged
by the woman who does the dishes.
She had no right to talk to you like that...
No, no.
I... crossed the line.
Okay, done. You ready to go?
Yeah.
Hey, Bob, can I borrow a couple of eggs?
Hey. What the hell was that about?
Your husband canceled our golf trip.
Did he?
He said you think
I'm planning to seduce him.
We should talk about that...
after I get the eggs.
Why would you even go there?
Look, I know about your history, Bob...
or should I say "flipper"?
Ah. Well, Lee's a fine one to talk.
Did he tell you about
the summer he stalked Ryan Seacrest?
Okay, look, I don't want
to fight about this.
How could you think that, Gaby? You know me.
No, I don't! I thought I did.
I thought you were a fun gay guy
who I had something in common with,
and then I find out you're into sports
and spending time with my husband.
What the hell was that about?
It's about me being lonely!
You ever see anybody coming
around here to visit me?
You ever see me going out
on a Saturday night?
Ever since Lee left,
all I do is work and
come home to an empty house.
You know, I was so happy
to get your invitation to dinner.
And when Carlos wanted to hang out,
I thought, this is great.
I got a social life again.
Now to find out you thought I had an agenda?
Oh, Bob. I'm sorry. I-I didn't know.
Well... now you do.
Let me get those eggs for you.
Carlos can go on the weekend.
Really?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Oh! And if you ever do feel the need
to flip a straight guy on the Lane,
I'd start with Tom Scavo.
I always felt he was three beers away.
Two.
How was your meeting?
Good.
Barbara's going to hire us.
We're officially a design firm.
That's great.
Can I ask you something?
Are you upset with this arrangement?
Because I'm getting a vibe.
I should go.
You are out of diapers.
I'll pick some up tomorrow.
Susan, please. I need to know.
Are you angry with me?
Yes. Yes, I'm angry.
Why? All I did was give you a job.
Yeah, the wrong job.
When Renee called me,
I thought you were asking me
to work with you in the design firm.
Oh, no!
I was so excited.
I knew I'd be good at that.
And then I find out
you just want me to be your nanny.
I had no idea.
But you know... and don't get me wrong,
I love you for the gesture,
but I hate you for it, too,
because I'm not in the position to say no.
I-I am beyond sorry.
It's okay.
It's just this awful reminder
that all of my friends
look at my differently now.
I'm the poor one.
Susan!
These money troubles... they're temporary,
but how we feel about you, our friendship...
that's never going to change.
Thank you for that.
Ohh, come here.
You know, I've never said
this to a nanny before...
how about we go downstairs
and get a little drunk?
Well, you're the boss.
Are you coming to bed?
I wanna make love again.
With an invitation like that...
No.
Let me.
You've turned out to be the perfect wife.
That's sweet,
but not entirely true.
You don't think I'm trustworthy.
What?
You won't tell me why
you're moving your ex-cellmate
into your old house.
Darling, I'd prefer not
to discuss that right now.
We don't need to.
Yeager already told me what you're up to.
What?
We had a nice long chat.
He told me what you've got
planned for our neighbors.
I must say, I was shocked...
to say the least.
I know what I'm doing
might sound crazy to you,
but you don't understand
how much I despise these people.
You don't understand
how much I need these people to suffer
for what they did to me.
Well, that's where you're wrong, Paul.
I understand vengeance.
Completely.
Wow.
You really are the perfect wife.
I'm sorry I left the restaurant like that.
I just couldn't go back to
that table and face your mother.
Oh. Whew.
So why didn't you tell me about
the whole menopause thing?
I was afraid of how you'd react.
You really think I would care
about something like that?
Oh, Keith,
I like you...
more than I ever intended to.
I always knew there was an expiration date
on this relationship.
What?
You are 17 years younger than me.
That's a big number. It means something.
Not to me.
It might.
There are other considerations.
So you can't get pregnant.
Who cares?
That doesn't bother you?
No.
No.
We could adopt.
So long as I get to teach someone
how to throw a ball,
I don't care whose D.N.A. they got.
Oh, Keith.
Not only can I not have children...
I don't want them.
I've already done that.
It was wonderful, but I've done it.
Oh.
And you...
you are gonna be such an amazing father,
and I would never ask you
to give up that experience.
Why are we even talking about this?
I... we've been dating
for two months. Why...
I... it's... it's too soon
to talk about kids, right?
I suppose.
Let's... let's take our time.
I-I just wanna... I...
I-I just want us to keep being happy, okay?
Hey, I was just about
to head over to your place
to pick up Carlos.
Yeah, about that... uh, I've decided
Carlos shouldn't go with you this weekend.
What? Oh, for God sake.
Ah! Wait! Let me finish!
I've been thinking about what you told me,
and I realized there's somebody else
you'd have more fun with.
Yeah, go. Shh!
You've gotta be kidding me!
Gaby called to say that
you were lonely and depressed,
and once I stopped laughing,
I actually felt bad for you.
We only broke up four months ago.
How did you gain this much weight?
Okay! Okay, now that
we're done saying hello,
let's talk about this fabulous weekend.
Did you seriously think
I would take him? We broke up!
And it's time to put
the pieces back together.
Let's be honest.
You've been miserable without Lee.
And you've been miserable without Bob.
That's why you're gettin' so fat.
You may not think I'm your friend, but I am,
and I am smart enough to know
that you need something more in your life
than a straight guy to go play golf with.
You need somebody to love.
And...
you need somebody who will love you back.
Gaby, I appreciate what you're doing,
and I think... Lee knows I still love him.
But...
There are still huge issues between us.
Huh.
Maybe it's time to work those out.
I'd hate to see that
fabulous resort weekend go to waste.
Oh, come on. Talk to each other.
Do it for me, as your friend.
Oh.
Oh, I forgot. One more thing...
Okay! Never mind. I'm... I'm good.
Humiliation...
it's not always something we can avoid.
We may have wives
who insult our masculinity.
We may take jobs...
we feel are beneath us.
We may have boyfriends
who make us feel old.
Yes, there are all sorts of ways
to be humiliated in life.
But the surest way to get your dignity back
is to get what you've been waiting for.
I found out what Paul is up to.
He told me everything.
Oh, baby.
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you, mama.

Previously on...
With Mike working in Alaska,
Susan took a job as a nanny.
Bree's relationship with Keith's mother...
Is Bree the one who's gonna
be giving me my grandchildren?
Got off to a rocky start.
That was a million years ago.
Tom and Renee had a secret.
She can never know what happened between us.
Paul's wife had a change of heart...
I wanna make love again.
And a very big secret of her own.
Baby.
Mama.
Felicia Tillman knew many things.
She knew Paul Young had killed her sister.
She knew she had to find proof.
And she knew she would need help.
Felicia also knew she was
lucky to have a daughter
who did what she was told.
He's said nothing to you?
You've been living there for months now.
Well, I've tried to ask him questions,
but he refuses to discuss aunt Martha.
Did you look through his things?
Maybe he has some sort of journal.
Well, I've looked some.
Look again.
Is he still bothering you for sex?
N-not really.
I'm surprised.
He seems like the type who
wouldn't take no for an answer.
You slept with him, didn't you?
Beth!
He was going to kick me out.
I had to do something.
Oh, please don't be angry.
We always knew
getting justice for aunt Martha
would require sacrifices.
But this...
I allowed my own daughter
to be defiled by that man.
It wasn't that bad, mama.
Are you saying you enjoyed it?
No! Of course not.
It just wasn't as unpleasant
as I thought it... would be.
Well, if you've got the stomach for it...
this could work to our advantage.
Well, what do you mean?
Sex makes men stupid.
They say things in the dark
they can barely remember come sunrise.
You want me to ask
about aunt Martha's murder
in the middle of...
I'm not saying use it as foreplay.
But afterwards,
when you're both just lying there,
when he's...
spent...
get him talking about the past.
Maybe he'll let some detail slip,
something we can use, okay?
I'll try, mama. I should go.
And, Beth?
Sex makes women stupid, too.
They start feeling things that
they have no business feeling.
Do you understand?
I do, mama.
Yes, Felicia Tillman knew many things,
and if her daughter were stupid enough
to fall in love with Paul Young,
Felicia knew she would have
to punish them both.
Thanksgiving... it's a time
for defrosting turkeys...
for visiting families...
for performing in pageants.
Thanksgiving is also a time for shopping...
Well, don't just sit there
scratching yourself. Help me.
And stress.
Frijoles, tamales?
Babe, I think you got the wrong bags.
Where are the yams and the cranberry sauce?
Hector and Carmen have a big mexican dinner
every Thanksgiving.
Since we invited them over,
I told them I'd serve
their favorite dishes, like...
chorizo stuffing, bollitos,
Jalapeño corn bread.
I thought it'd be nice for Grace.
It's our first holiday
we're together as a family.
That was very sweet of you.
Yeah. So good luck. We eat at 2:00.
Wait, wait.
I'm cooking?
Yeah. You're the one
who knows about mexican stuff.
You roll your R's, you call soccer football...
You're mocking me because
I'm proud of my culture?
No! I'm celebrating it.
And there's two bags
of your culture right there.
Start the party.
So, Lynette. Hi.
What are your plans for Thanksgiving?
Same as always...
cook by myself for four hours,
clean by myself for three hours,
eat with my family for eight minutes.
Well, this year, how about coming to...
We're in.
I haven't even invited you yet.
You can invite me over
for turkey and a punch in the face.
If it gets me out of cooking, I'm there.
Oh. Wonderful.
Oh. Wait. Susan was
already coming to our place.
Is it okay if she comes, too?
Well, I suppose she'll want overtime,
but I could use the extra kitchen help.
As a guest.
Oh, come on.
What have you got against Susan?
She's always so perky and poor.
It's an annoying combination.
She's my friend, and it is Thanksgiving.
I suppose it is a time to be thankful...
and I'm thankful I'm not her.
Oh, what the hell. She can come.
There's been a change of plans.
We're all having Thanksgiving
over at Renee's. You, too.
She's okay with me and M.J. coming?
Of course. You know how she loves children.
Yeah. Medium rare.
What are we doing?
Oh, I'm trying to get Paige to sleep,
and if I stop...
that happens.
I figure 12 more laps, and she'll be asleep,
and then I can put her down.
You know what?
I'm thinking it's about
time we sleep-trained her.
Sleep train?
Yeah, yeah. Here. You put 'em in their crib,
and essentially,
you let 'em cry it out. Come on.
Yeah, I know what it is.
I just never really got the point of it.
The point is she learns
to put herself to sleep.
The first night she cries for 20 minutes,
the second, ten.
Before long, everyone's happy.
Except the lonely little person
who was crying and
now thinks she was abandoned.
I know it sounds harsh,
but it's really a gift
you're giving the child.
The gift of a tear-stained pillow.
What a lucky little girl.
Something wrong?
No.
You sure?
You seem like you were a million miles away
while we were making love.
Well...
it's just that...
Talk to me.
I met a woman today a-at the store,
and when I told her who I was married to...
she said you killed Martha Huber.
What have I told you about idle gossip?
She said you had a motive.
Martha was blackmailing your wife.
This is ridiculous.
You are a passionate man.
I know that firsthand,
but sometimes our emotions
can make us do crazy things.
If Martha was responsible
for Mary Alice's suicide...
Stop it.
Do you honestly believe that I am capable
of killing another person?
Martha's sister sure thinks you are.
Well, her opinion doesn't matter.
Why not?
Everybody knows Felicia Tillman is crazy.
Martha said to my wife
that she couldn't trust
a thing that her sister said
due to her severe mental problems.
Really?
You're surprised?
The woman cut off her own fingers
to frame me for murder.
Who does that?
That's a good point.
Bree?
I brought these so if you saw me coming,
you wouldn't shoot me.
Uh, Keith told me you have guns?
Thank you for letting me off the hook.
In my defense, I'm an ugly drunk.
Well, you found out your son was dating
a slightly older woman.
Of course you were thrown off balance.
It wasn't just that.
I, uh, I've been going
through some stuff lately.
Oh. Is, uh, everything okay?
Ever since Richard retired from the army,
things have been... strained.
Well, there's always a period of adjustment.
It's more than that.
He was always thousands of miles away.
We got so good at being apart,
we forgot how to be together.
Well, have you discussed this with him?
I want to, but every time we talk,
it turns into a fight.
Trying to pick a movie friday night...
that-that turned into
a 3-hour screaming match.
Well, holding it inside isn't the solution.
You need to tell him how you feel.
Trust me. You'll be glad you did.
Well, it's just so much easier
when Keith is around.
He's the one thing we agree on.
I mean, I'm glad you two
are spending Thanksgiving together,
but we're sure gonna miss him at our table.
Hmm. Hey, why don't you join us?
Oh, oh, no. No, no, no. No.
I-I wasn't fishing for an invitation.
I know you weren't.
We would love to have you.
You are so sweet,
and I promise to be on my best behavior.
I know you will, because as Keith told you,
I have guns.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I was trying to get Mike on the phone,
but between the time change
and his schedule,
we weren't able to connect.
Aw, that's too bad.
I just put Paige down for a nap.
Come. Have some iced tea.
Maybe you can try Mike tonight after work.
Maybe.
Wow. She sounds really unhappy.
Shouldn't we do something about that?
You're right.
So... what's the weather like in Alaska
this time of the year?
Cold.
Good tea.
Really, really good tea.
Although it could use some lemon.
Um, I'll be right back.
Susan.
We stopped keeping lemons
under the baby a while ago.
I'm sorry. I couldn't take it.
Look, it's not fun for me
to hear Paige cry either,
but in the long run,
it's going to be better for her.
It's not better for me.
I tried letting her cry yesterday.
It was too upsetting.
Look at my nails. They're gone.
I hate to say it because you're my friend,
but this is your job.
I need you to do it my way.
I get it. You're the boss. The mean, cold...
Susan.
Sorry.
Unfeeling boss.
Oh, I thought you were the cable guy.
I'm trying to get free premium channels.
No, no, just me.
Lynette wanted me to bring
this over for thursday.
She didn't think it'd stand
a chance at our place.
Okay. Bye.
Uh, Tom?
Oh. Oh, oh, right. Here.
Do you mind putting that in the kitchen?
My hands are kinda...
Sure. Sure.
So... here you go.
Chocolate cream thigh... p-pie.
I said "pie."
Are you blushing?
Tom, you've seen it before.
I seem to remember you caught me
in a towel then, too.
Well, you probably don't even remember.
Blue towel, white stripes,
Coney Island beach club.
I-it was a good towel.
Uh, Tom.
What do you think?
What?
Oh, relax. I'm not hitting on you.
It's just...
Well, come on. I'm divorced. I'm vulnerable.
I'll take my compliments where I can.
I know it's been over 20 years,
but how do I look?
You look incredible.
I gotta go.
Table.
Oh, that reminds me.
I invited your parents
to Thanksgiving dinner.
What about the last ten minutes
reminded you of my parents?
I was working up the menu in my head.
So when you were moaning...
I thought of a new recipe
for chestnut stuffing with pancetta.
That does sound good.
Ah. I wish it was just you
and me for Thanksgiving.
I had a whole night planned.
Well, how about we do something
special next weekend?
Just you and me?
Yes. We'll go someplace romantic,
and I will plan the whole thing.
Great.
Just don't do it while we're making love.
I am famished. How about
I rummage around in your kitchen
and find us something to eat?
Mm.
Hey! Look who's here.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Hey, happy Thanksgiving.
Ay, it all smells so wonderful.
Well, Carlos and I have been working
our butts off all day.
She did her hair for two hours
and told me where the can opener was.
Who set the table?
Juanita.
Under my supervision.
Well, we're happy to be here.
Si.
Grace, sweetie, you wanna go up
and play with Juanita and Celia
before we eat?
Yeah.
So who wants a drink?
I made margaritas.
She is very proud of her culture.
Hey. Carlos, what's spanish for
"No sex for a month"?
Ah, Carmen knows.
So, Gaby, what'd you do with the pies?
What?
I kinda forgot to pick 'em up.
I cooked this entire meal,
and you forget dessert?
You had one thing to do.
It was your whole
"Where's the can opener?" thing.
It just threw me.
Well,
go throw yourself
in the car and get the pies.
I can't drive. I just had a glass of wine.
We'll just have something else for dessert.
I think I have some
leftover halloween candy...
And pudding mix. Who doesn't love pudding?
Gaby... get the pies.
Uh... I can drive you.
Thank you, Hector.
Oh, fine. Let's go get your precious pies.
And lose the attitude.
This is your screwup, not mine.
Carlos, what's spanish
for "You're sleeping on the couch tonight"?
Carmen's got that one, too.
She...
Hey, Renee.
Happy, happy Thanksgiving.
Okay, you live in an apartment.
Take it down a notch.
Oh. Hello, M.J.
M.J., what do you say to Mrs. Perry?
She needs medication?
That's what we say about her.
What do we say to her?
Thank you for having us.
Precious.
What's this chalk line?
No kids beyond this point.
Your mommy can bring your food to you.
Seriously? The kids' table's
in the driveway?
I put it in the street,
but the cops made me move it.
Hey, happy Thanksgiving.
Oh. Where's my little Paige?
Oh, we are trying to keep
her on her sleep schedule,
so Porter and Preston are watching her.
But don't worry, Susan.
I told them if she cries,
they can pick her up after 20 minutes.
20 minutes. You're up to 20 minutes now.
If they even hear her
over the football game.
What?
Happy Thanksgiving.
What?
Told you she forgot. Let's go.
No. No. Remember how awful
you felt when you found out
Roy and I spent last Thanksgiving
at pancake castle and
you invited us to your house
for the next year?
It's next year.
I'm... sorry. It slipped my mind.
Well, that's okay.
We can go back to pancake castle.
No, we can't.
The board of health shut 'em down.
Those weren't blueberries.
Wait, wait, wait.
Of course you're welcome to eat with us.
Well, thank you, Bree.
Hey. We're here.
Oh, look. Invited guests.
We'll get out of the way.
Keith.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Richard, Mary.
They were honking at you
because you were driving slow
in the fast lane.
No. I was driving
the legal speed limit in the left lane.
Otherwise known as the fast lane. Hi.
Happy Thanksgiving.
We'd have been here sooner,
but, uh...
Drop it, Richard.
Come on. Move!
I think it's an accident.
Well, they better be dead.
The bakery closes in ten minutes.
Maybe we should just forget the pies.
Are you crazy? If I show up empty-handed,
Carlos will go all Ricky Ricardo on my ass.
Take the shoulder.
What?
It's totally clear,
and we can pass by this whole mess.
Gaby, it's against the law.
Hector, I am sweating in a pickup,
and my buzz is wearing off.
You do not wanna tangle with me.
Punch it!
Maybe he didn't see us.
Sir...
You do realize that the shoulder
is used just for emergencies?
Officer, hi. Are we glad to see you.
We could really use
a police escort to the bakery.
It closes in ten minutes.
That's not an emergency, ma'am.
"Ma'am"? Ow. Talk about police brutality.
License and registration, please.
I-I have the registration.
And do you have a driver's license?
Sir... are you a citizen
of the united states?
Hey! Racist much?
Just because he's got dark skin
and drives a clunker
and has a coat hanger for an antenna
doesn't make him illegal.
Gaby, please!
He has rights. He pays taxes.
We're getting your name,
officer... Martinez.
Damn!
Just give him your license
so we can get outta here.
Hector?
Sir, step out of the vehicle
and put your hands on the car, please.
Hector.
Isn't that your truck?
Why is it moving like that?
Where's my husband?
Where's the pie?
Gaby, what happened?
Please don't yell at me.
That was my first time driving stick shift,
and my nerves are shattered.
Well, where's Hector?
He got arrested.
Arrested? Why?
Well, traffic was awful,
and the bakery was closing,
so Hector... a-and I begged him not to,
drove up on the shoulder,
and the police caught us.
Police?
Grace, get in the truck now.
But we haven't eaten yet.
I don't care. Let's go! Where's my purse?
What the hell is going on?
I think they're illegals.
Are they gonna deport Hector?
I don't know. They just took him
and left me in a car
that I don't know how to drive.
Okay, Carmen, wait.
We can get your husband out of this.
We'll hire a lawyer.
They will have him on a bus
back to Mexico by tomorrow.
I have to move out of our house
before they track down our address.
Where are you going?!
I have relatives in Texas.
We'll stay with them
until I can think of what to do next.
But what about Grace?
When will I see her again?
I don't know.
Say good-bye, Grace.
Good-bye, Gaby.
Hey, kids, I put some snacks on the table.
Mrs. Perry slapped the caterer,
so dinner's gonna be a little late.
Do you hear crying?
Maybe it's the caterer.
No, I think it's Paige.
Oh, yeah. She's been crying for a long time.
She has?
Who wants to play some football?
Okay. Go long, go long.
Oops! That's my bad!
I'll get it!
Oh! Look! Ha! Did it again.
I'll get it!
Let's go, boys. Come on!
3rd and 6. You gotta throw it.
Oh, he's not gonna.
Come on! Throw the ball!
Ohh!
Ugh. It's like they're trying to lose.
Now 3rd and 16 from the 16
to give to Blake on the draw,
And Blake is hammered
at the line for no gain.
Ohh!
Come on!
So, uh, Richard, tell us,
what are your plans for retirement?
We're, uh, we're still discussing that.
He wants to sail down the coast
of south America by himself.
Bree, this cranberry sauce is delicious.
What is your secret?
Well...
Might I remind you,
the plan was always for us
to sail down the coast of south America.
Oh.
Please tell us that secret, Bree.
I'd love to hear it.
Is it cinnamon?
If it isn't, can we talk about cinnamon?
I knew a stripper
in Baltimore named cinnamon.
Nice broad.
You changed the plan.
You were the one that said
you wanted to keep working.
Well, I'm sorry if I built up
a successful practice
while you were traipsing around the world.
Traipsing?
Yes.
Like when I traipsed through Iraq.
Iraq! My goodness. What was that like?
When I think about it now,
doesn't seem so bad.
So... Richard,
we know that you like sailing.
What about you, Mary?
Do you have any hobbies?
Ask him.
Excuse me?
He has known me for 35 years.
I'd be curious if he could name
even one thing I like to do.
Um...
Bitch?
No. The stripper's name was ginger.
Cinnamon was her sister. Killed by a cab.
You're not happy unless you have
something to complain about.
Dad, mom. Come on. You're guests here.
Why do I even bother?
It's like talking to a wall.
A wall that paid for your medical school
after your homemade wooden
puzzle business went belly-up.
And everything you ever did was a success?
Iraq? Nice job!
I caught some shrapnel in Korea.
Came this close to being a lady.
See, Bree? This is just
what we talked about.
You-you talked to my mother?
Bree said I should tell you how I feel.
Well, here is how I feel. I want a divorce.
What?
Thank you, Bree. I do feel better.
You told my mom to get a divorce?
I never said "divorce."
You want out of this?
Fine! I'm happy to oblige!
Dad! Mom, wait!
And you didn't wanna come.
I love the stuffing.
Are you sure? Not too dry?
No. It's yummy. Hmm.
Did you use pecans?
Yes. It's my mother's recipe.
It's probably a lot different
from the stuffing
you had as a kid.
Actually, mama and I didn't
really celebrate Thanksgiving.
What?
Daddy left when I was very young.
After that, mama said
we didn't have anything to be thankful for.
So you never had people over?
No. It was always just...
mama and me.
That's too bad.
When I was 12, I did ask mama
if I could have a friend
from school to eat with us.
Danny Sullivan.
I didn't tell her I'd invited a boy
until Thanksgiving morning.
Well, what happened?
She started screaming at me...
saying boys were only after one thing.
When he showed up and knocked on the door,
she wouldn't let me answer it.
We just... sat there and ate
while he knocked and... knocked.
Finally, it stopped.
Your mother sounds like
a very unhappy woman.
I didn't notice it
so much when I was a child.
But now I'm starting to realize just how...
damaged she is.
Is that why you never introduced us?
I just never thought you two
would have much in common.
I can think of one thing.
We both love you.
You know, I think it's good
I waited this long
to have a real Thanksgiving.
Why's that?
Because now I actually have
something to be thankful for.
Hey, guys.
I brought you some turkey.
Can I have some?
Well, sure, but... where's your mom?
I thought you guys were throwing
the football around.
I haven't seen her since
she kicked it down to your house.
And how long ago was that?
A while ago, before the baby stopped crying.
And 1:35 left here in the 2nd.
... at their own 42-yard line,
trailing 21 to 3.
Hey, guys, how's it goin'?
Uh, Dallas is losing.
Where's the baby?
They have no passing game.
Guys!
Susan?
Ahh. Well, now I'm not suspicious at all.
Come on, Susan!
Aah! Oh!
God, you scared me.
You... stay right there. Guys?
Hey.
Will you watch the game upstairs?
I need to talk to Susan.
When did Susan get here?
Beats me.
What the hell?
I could hear her crying four houses away.
Yes. And last night, she cried just as loud,
but two minutes later,
she put herself to sleep.
She was self-soothing.
The system was working.
I don't care. I think it's
a crappy system for lazy moms.
Lazy moms? Who are you to talk?
You have one kid every... 18 years.
Me... I've got five in the
house at the same time.
It's a war. So if I need
to put my baby on a schedule
to stop my life
from spiraling out of control,
that's what I'm gonna do.
Well... you're gonna have to do it alone,
'cause I quit.
Whoa. Hold on. Isn't that a little extreme?
Lynette, I'm sorry.
I cannot stand by and
listen to that baby cry.
Even for five minutes?
Even for one minute.
It's more than I can handle.
I listen to M.J. crying himself to sleep
every night... because he misses his dad.
I cry myself to sleep
because my kid is crying.
There's just too much crying
in my life. I can't take it.
Oh, sweetie. Shh. I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
I'm sorry to dump all this on you.
I have been emotional all day.
God...
It's Thanksgiving, and I...
I haven't even gotten to speak to Mike.
You wanna call him? You can use my phone.
Talk as long as you like.
Are you sure? It... it's expensive.
Well... it's either talking to your husband
or self-soothing,
and I know how much you love that.
Oh! Thank god you haven't left.
What are you doing here?
You don't have to leave.
Carlos and I hired our friend Bob.
He's a lawyer. He'll find a way to help you.
How? We're breaking the law.
Well, at least talk to him.
You can't just pack up and go.
We always knew this day might come.
This was the plan.
I'm sticking to it.
Carmen, we should talk about this.
Hi, Gaby.
Mama, am I supposed to pack
all my clothes and books?
Uh, just your favorite things,
mija, for a nice, long visit.
I'm going to meet my cousins.
I heard.
Look, Carmen, I know you're a proud woman,
but you have to let us help you.
We're family. I'm afraid if I let you go,
I'll never see Grace again.
And you might not see Juanita.
Stay with us until we can figure things out.
They'll never look for you there.
At the very least,
we can have a few more days with the girls.
Please.
I'm not ready to say good-bye yet.
Top you off?
Thanks. I'm good.
Where the heck did Lynette go?
She can't be that far.
So the house looks great.
Thanks.
You like living here?
Uh, yeah. Sure.
That didn't sound very convincing.
Well, it's nothing against Fairview.
It's just... I'm surrounded
by couples and married people.
And I'm alone.
Would you believe for the first time?
Well, if I know you, that's not gonna last.
I don't know.
You know, people used to say
I was a beautiful woman.
Now they say I'm a beautiful woman
for my age.
Please.
I just saw you in a towel.
Did you get your premium channels?
I did...
and high-speed internet.
There you go.
Mmm.
Oh, you know, there was a time
where I could have any man I wanted,
and... I did.
But I did not choose wisely.
I went for the rich guys, the famous guys,
the ones who bought me pretty things.
I should've been looking for
a man who was kind and gentle,
the kind of man you'd actually
wanna raise a family with.
I gotta hand it to Lynette.
She sure knows how to pick 'em.
Ohh.
Hmm. What are you guys talking about?
Well...
You, actually.
I hope it was complimentary.
Uh, very.
Hey.
Come on in.
My dad's here. He's in the other room.
Oh. How's he doing?
Weirdly okay.
And how about you?
Freaked out.
Guess it doesn't matter if you're 4 or 34
when your mom and dad
aren't together anymore.
It's horrible, I know.
You know what's ironic?
Thanksgiving, big family holiday.
That's the day I start thinking
there's no point in being married.
You can't think like that.
Why not?
They were married for 35 years.
If it could fall apart that quickly...
It didn't.
It's been a long time coming, Keith
you just haven't been around to see it.
Hmm. Like that would have made it easier.
Son, all I'm saying is try not
to be cynical about marriage.
Really? 'cause I see a lot of
divorced people in this room.
Sorry.
No. You're right. I'm divorced.
But I will never give up on marriage.
Because when it works, it's great.
And I still believe
it could happen again for me.
And I cannot believe I just said
that to my boyfriend
in front of his father.
You wanna take a walk?
Maybe I can salvage one
nice Thanksgiving memory
out of this day?
I'd love to.
All right. I'll get my coat.
I hope he's gonna be okay.
Well, it'll take some time,
but I promise I'll help him through it.
Keith's a lucky guy to have you.
Thank you.
I knew you were special
from the moment I met you.
You ready to go?
All set.
How's it going? What have you found out?
Nothing.
He still insists he didn't do it.
Clearly, it's too soon.
You haven't gained his trust yet.
You know what you should do?
Join some wine-of-the-month club.
Start getting him drunk on a regular basis.
Maybe he'll let something slip.
What's wrong?
Mama...
have you ever considered
the possibility that...
That what?
That Paul didn't kill aunt Martha.
No.
Have you?
Well...
no one actually saw him do it.
Oh, my god.
He swears he didn't kill her.
And you believe him.
I want you out of that house.
Mama. You will leave here, get your things,
and get out of that house today.
I can't.
Why not?
He's my husband.
What?
He's nice to me.
Who cares?!
He's a cold-blooded killer!
Mama, the guards.
I didn't raise you to be this stupid!
Sit down,
or your visit's over.
Don't touch me!
Mama!
I will not allow you
to fall in love with a monster!
Do you hear me?!
Beth!
Mom, we want breakfast.
Okay, I'll be there in a second.
Bob, there has got to be some way
we can get Hector his papers.
Isn't there somebody that
we can throw money at?
Guys, it's too late for Hector,
and as long as Carmen is here,
she runs the risk of being deported, too.
She either turns herself in, or...
I have to disappear.
You said Carmen's at risk. What about Grace?
She was born here.
She's an american citizen.
Oh.
Mom!
I should go.
Wow. This is great. Waffles are my favorite.
Good. You can have them anytime you want.
Really? Wow. I wish
I could live here all the time.
Well, you never know.
There might be a way
we can make that happen.
Once a year,
we remember to stop and count our blessings.
We give thanks for
the friends who understand us...
the lovers who makes us happy...
the children who do our bidding...
Yes, we must always be thankful
for what we've been given...
even if it's just an opportunity.
Corrected by MystEre
Renee and Tom discussed their past.
I seem to remember you caught
me in a towel then, too.
Bree's Thanksgiving dinner...
I want a divorce!
I'm happy to oblige!
Dad! Mom!
Went up in flames.
Look who's here!
Gaby's dinner ended
when Hector got arrested...
I think they're illegals.
I have to move out of our house!
And she was afraid of losing
her biological daughter Grace.
Stay with us until
we can figure things out.
And Paul's plan...
You are the proud new owner
of your old house.
Was set in motion.
So Paige and I will be
at the park for about 30 minutes.
Great. I should have all
the clothes packed up by then.
Oh, shoot. I forgot the pacifier.
I didn't. It's in the diaper bag.
Have a good time.
There are certain things
every parent must remember...
Which toys can't be thrown away...
which vegetables must not be served...
which clothes should never be mended...
but the one thing every parent can forget...
is how quickly their children grow up.
What's going on in here?
Uh, Lisa Ellison is pregnant,
so I'm gonna give her some baby clothes.
Paige has grown out of all her onesies.
Wow, that was fast.
So fast. Isn't there a way
we could keep her small?
Well, we could stop feeding her.
Then we could save money
on food and clothes.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah, it just hit me that
this is my last onesie.
After Paige, no more babies.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Mm.
I mean, weren't you
the one who threw confetti...
after the doctor tied your tubes?
Yes, but now I'm thinking that
it's just going by too quick...
Ohh.
And before you know it,
they'll be grown, and...
just be you and me.
Yeah. You know what
the best part of that is?
No.
It'll just be you... and me.
What are you doing?
Giving you...
a preview of what
our retirement's gonna be like.
What about... what about the kids?
They all left for school. I saw 'em.
But... in the nursery?
In front of Peter Pan?
It's about time he grew up.
Yes, there are certain things
every parent must remember.
Ohh! I... forgot Paige's doll.
I'll-I'll... I'll tell her it's dead.
Locking the door...
is one of them.
It's a question we all ask ourselves.
Do I trust the folks who live next door?
Can I count on the woman
who lives down the block?
Will that couple across the street
be there when I need them?
Yes, good neighbors are
people we can rely on.
Great neighbors
are the ones who do exactly
what they are told.
So this is what you want me to sign?
Yes. Down at the bottom.
Is there a problem?
I-I'm just a little sad, that's all.
Now, what do you have to be sad about?
I'm paying you well over market value.
I know. It's just... I love the Lane.
Everybody's always been so kind to me.
To just up and move at my age...
The neighborhood is about to change.
In a few months,
you won't recognize this street.
It's better to go now,
with your memories intact.
What do you mean, it's gonna change?
You don't have to worry about that.
All you need to know is
that I'm helping you.
I am so sorry. I got hung up.
Don't worry. It's done.
Mr. Scully sold? But...
I had a lot of details to work out.
I mean, length of escrow,
disclosure agreements...
You'll still get your commission.
Okay. So... what happens now?
Now?
Now I let the neighborhood in on my plan.
Plan?
You have a plan?
Hi!
Oh, so now she knocks.
It's Susan. I'm entering the house.
It's okay, Susan. We are totally clothed.
Sweetie...
you avoided making eye contact
with us all day yesterday.
Can we move past this?
Yeah, I think the only fair thing now
is for us to see you and Mike naked.
Okay, you were right. It's not funny.
Yeah?
I just want to say "congratulations."
For what?
Well, I don't mean to be crass,
but when I walked in on you guys,
I couldn't help but notice
that Tom is quite...
gifted.
Oh, that.
"Oh, that"?
When I opened the door,
I thought you two had company.
I mean, I'm not sure if it
was all the tiny furniture
in the nursery, but he looked...
I get it, I get it.
I'm a very lucky woman.
So why haven't you ever mentioned it
to me and the girls?
Mention it?
When we went for margaritas that night
and we all kind of told each other
about our husbands'... accomplishments,
how come you never told us you
were sleeping with Tommy tripod?
Tommy tripod? How many
more of these do you have?
Six.
I'm serious.
You were so tight-lipped,
that we just assumed
that Tom was one of those, you know,
button-on-a-fur-coat kind of guys.
It's just something
I don't care to advertise.
What do I care if people
think he's got a dinky one?
Hey, Carmen.
What's with the map?
I just spoke to Hector.
Oh, my God. How is he? Where is he?
Staying with his cousins
in sabinas... Mexico.
Grace and I will be leaving
for Texas in two days.
What? So soon?
Gaby, we discussed this.
We're staying with people we know
for a few weeks until
Hector crosses the border and joins us.
And then what?
I guess we'll try to get jobs,
find a place to live.
Where? What jobs?
You have a daughter
you're dragging into all this.
Grace is a strong girl.
Yes, I know, but is this
what's best for her?
Okay, look, I'm just...
putting it out there.
Let Grace stay here with us.
Just until you and Hector get settled.
That could take months.
I don't mind. That way
she can at least stay in school.
She'll be safe, be with family.
Hector and I are all the family she needs.
She comes with me.
Carmen, I don't mean
to make you mad. It's just I...
I have a say in this, too.
I'm her birth mother!
And I'm Juanita's!
Does that mean I should take her with me?
Take her where? To run? To hide?
That's the life you're making Grace live!
But here, she can have anything
she wants, just like Juanita!
Oh, so she can become a spoiled
girl who never thinks of others,
just like Juanita.
Hey, there is nothing wrong with my kid.
No, you're right.
It's not her fault
she's being raised by a bad mother.
And if a life of running and hiding
keeps that from happening to Grace,
then that's what I'll do.
So we'll just tell people that
you slipped in the bathroom
and bumped your head.
We're old. People expect that.
What were you thinking with that book?
I thought it would add a little spice.
"Kama sutra." Kama sutures.
Where'd that come from?
Wasn't there yesterday.
Take these. Take these home.
I gotta make sure people know about this.
Go! Go, go, go, go.
"Correctional center"? What is that, a jail?
I called the city.
They say it's "transitional housing"
for felons under house arrest.
A halfway house for convicts,
on our street?
Exactly.
I don't understand.
The city bought this house?
No. I did.
You're responsible for this?
Sure am.
What could you possibly be thinking?
The day I was released from prison,
I felt so blessed.
I knew that I was coming home
to the loving embrace of
this beautiful neighborhood.
And most inmates, when they're released,
don't have that kind of support.
Most of them are isolated,
which leads them to commit more crimes.
Bringing them to a place like this,
where they can interact with folks like you,
might just keep a few of them
from making that unfortunate choice.
Come on, Paul. We've got children here.
And I'm not spending my golden years
borrowing a cup of sugar from
drug dealers and rapists.
I'm all for charity,
but our neighborhood
can't handle something like this.
Apparently, I have more faith
in you people than you do.
Oh, my God.
In a way, this halfway house
will be a testament
to how I feel about each
and every one of you.
Renee?
Oh, I've really got to start knocking.
What?
Lynette asked me to bring over
this birthday card
that got delivered to her house by mistake.
Thanks so much. You can toss it.
You're not gonna read it? Come on.
Someone who loves you took
the time to send a card.
"Happy Birthday from..."
"Dr. Frank at midtown dental."
Oh, look! You're due for a cleaning.
Good-bye, Susan.
No, wait.
So it's your birthday, huh?
Do you have something special planned?
I haven't celebrated my birthday
since the third time I turned 28.
Hey! What do you say you and I go out?
No candles, no cake, no singing.
Just enough booze to wash away the pain.
Why do you assume I'm in pain?
I was talking about my pain.
I've really been missing Mike
since he's been in Alaska, and...
ugh, I have a bunion that's bothering me...
Fine, fine.
We'll have dinner. Let's just make it early.
I want to have a backup dinner lined up
just in case this one gets too depressing.
Oh, I promise you're gonna
have a great... time.
Hey, there's my favorite lawyer.
As it happens,
I need some good legal advice.
You mean free legal advice.
Well, yeah. Free is good.
So let's say hypothetically
I know a woman who's
in this country illegally.
You mean Carmen.
She's not the only illegal I know.
Half of Carlos' family
scaled a fence at some point.
Now, let's say this woman's daughter
is an American citizen.
You mean Grace?
Hello! Still hypothetically.
Now, could the daughter stay
here with another family
if, say, somebody
anonymously reported
the mother to immigration?
Yeah, as long as it's not the somebody
who called immigration,
because hypothetically,
she'd be burning in hell.
Oh, come on.
Carmen wants to drag Grace
all over Guadala-somewhere
while Hector figures out a way
to sneak back into the country.
Gaby, you can't do this. They're a family.
Just tell me... is it legal
or not for me to keep her?
Yes, technically, it's legal.
But just because something's
legal doesn't make it right.
Okay, jeez! You don't have
to jump down my throat.
Like I said, it was just... hypothetical.
Yeah, hi. Can I get the number
for the immigration department, please?
What do you want for dinner?
Pasta? Meatloaf?
I don't care. Meatloaf's good.
Why don't you talk about my penis?
Excuse me?
I overheard you and Susan talking.
I was surprised to find you'd never...
bragged about me.
There's a reason
they call them private parts.
And why would you care anyway?
I know what you gals talk
about when you get together.
Gaby lets everyone know
how much money Carlos has.
Susan talks about what a badass Mike is...
So...
So do I always have to be the joke?
The-the one who paid too much for the car,
the one who cried when
the cop pulled him over...
you don't have a problem
sharing my screwups,
but God forbid you give me
this one little victory.
Are we really having this conversation?
I am just saying,
for once it would be nice
if you gave me a little good press.
You know,
tell your friends...
what I bring to the table.
Please don't put it on the table.
I'm sorry. I was looking for
my contractor boyfriend,
not a... suave international spy.
Well, the restaurant is pretty, uh...
How do the kids say it? Snazzy?
You look wonderful. Hmm.
Shall we?
Hang on. Yeah, I just gotta
grab one thing out of my room.
Okay.
Oh, hey, Bree. I heard the door.
I thought you were pizza.
Hello, Richard.
Are we going to bed or getting up?
I don't know. Let's see.
Ahh. "Wheel of fortune." Getting up.
So how are you doing?
Not so hot. Mary's lawyer called today.
We're starting our divorce proceedings.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, the marriage has been
over for a long time,
but I had no idea what a kick
in the gut this was gonna be.
I guess it's just hitting me
that I could be alone
for the rest of my life.
Richard, that's ridiculous.
Take a look in the mirror.
I mean, after you shower.
You are a catch. You're smart,
adventurous, very handsome...
For a tired old guy in his 50s...
Stop wallowing in self-pity!
You were a major in the army.
Be strong.
The army is easy. There's structure.
They tell you what to do,
you do it. But this...
Fine! Then I'll tell you what to do.
Turn off the tv,
get dressed, and get out of this apartment.
And do what?
Ready to go?
Change of plans.
I've invited your father to join us.
I hope you don't mind.
Bree could see that I'm a little down.
No. No, it's fine.
It's not like I had
anything special planned.
Okay, I checked the bylaws.
We can all relax.
Paul can't open a halfway house
on this street
without approval from
the homeowners' association.
And since he only has one house...
He only gets one vote.
No way he gets a majority.
Thank God. Let's call
a meeting of the association
and take a vote so
we can get this over with.
Does this seem too easy?
I mean, Paul's a smart guy.
He wouldn't pull a stunt like this
unless he thought he could get away with it.
I wish Mike were here.
He'd just go over there
and scare some sense into him.
Do we know any other macho guys
who could do the job?
What about Carlos?
Oh, forget Carlos.
We've got a guy right here
that can do the job.
Roy.
Not me.
Hey, what about the gay?
He looks like he could do some damage.
Okay. How about
I just refresh everyone's coffee?
'Cause it looks like
that's all I'm good for.
Oh, can you be a love and
bring back more of these cookies?
You okay?
Bob? Roy?
Your friends think everybody on
the street is tougher than me.
That's ridiculous!
Hey, how about we send Lynette over there?
She got a set of cojones on her.
You see?
You see? This is all your fault!
Wh... h-how is it my fault?
'Cause you never say anything
positive about me. God forbid
you talk me up, make these people
think I'm a real man.
A real man?
Are you suggesting we make this
meeting a forum for your talent?
Why is it so hard for you
to say nice things about me?
I do, all the time.
Oh, but you prefer to emasculate me.
Emasculate you? No, I don't!
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
Oh, you want me to talk you up?
Yeah, that would be great!
Fine! I'll talk you up.
Listen, everybody. I've got an idea.
If we need someone
to intimidate Paul,
Tom can do it in the men's room.
What?
Oh, you didn't hear? Tom's packin'!
We're talkin' big, circus big. So big,
he can drive in
the car pool Lane when he's alone.
L-L-Lynette...
If it falls in the forest,
believe me... it makes a sound.
Th-that's enough. That...
The Washington monument
looks at it and says,
"I want to be you when I grow up."
Jeez, you'd think she'd smile more.
Grace, you want to go
to the kitchen for a little bit?
Why?
Maybe make yourself a snack.
You are such a brave little girl.
If anything bad ever happens,
you are surrounded by people who love you.
What are you talking about?
Gaby, immigration's here.
The men who took daddy?
Oh, don't worry, Grace.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Mama!
Grace, listen to me.
Go upstairs to Juanita's room
and do not move until I tell you.
No, mama! I want to stay with you!
I'll be fine.
I love you.
I love you.
Go, go.
These people are going to take me.
I need you to look after my baby.
You're not going anywhere.
Can I help you?
I'm Agent Jackson from I.C.E.
We're looking for
Carmen Sanchez. Is that you?
Okay, Mrs. Solis,
I'm going to the store now for oven cleaner.
Are you Carmen Sanchez?
Ma'am, we're from U.S.
immigration and customs enforcement.
Ay, dios mío!
I might be late tomorrow.
This is lovely, Keith.
Yeah, but it feels like something's missing.
What is it? Oh, I know. My father.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I know we've been having a lot of dinners
with him lately.
Oh, it's okay.
It's really sweet the way
you've been looking after him.
But I'm really glad it's just us tonight.
Me, too. Mm.
I'll check on our table.
Wanna grab me a drink?
Yeah, whiskey up, ice water back.
Can I help you?
Watson, party of two.
I'm the one who called earlier.
Oh, yes, of course.
Would you like the ring delivered
in our chocolate soufflé?
Oh, no. I'm too nervous to wait for dessert.
How about an appetizer?
We have the jumbo shrimp cocktail.
Not jumbo.
I-I don't want the shrimp
to make the ring look small.
Thank you.
Bree?
It's me, Tracy! Tracy Miller!
Of course! Oh, it's been years!
You look...
Incredible. Look at me!
I'm a stick. I've lost a ton.
Good for you.
What's, uh, Adam doing these days?
Sitting in his studio apartment
and cursing my divorce lawyer
for taking all of his money.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, don't be. I'm doing great.
They're ready for us.
Oh, my God. Is this Andrew?
I can't believe how grown up he is.
No, this is my boyfriend Keith.
Wow. I guess we're both doin' great.
After the mudslides,
there was an outbreak of cholera.
Half my village died.
That's when we paid the coyote
to bring us over the border.
Jeez, cholera? Getting shot at?
Doesn't anyone have a happy story
about coming to this country?
Gabrielle Solis? Your husband is here.
Oh.
Uh, good luck. I'm sure
I'll see you all again.
You seem like a very persistent lot.
You okay?
As long as you're not mad at me.
Are you kidding?
It's a very brave thing
that you did for Carmen.
Yeah, well, you know me,
always thinking about others.
So where are Carmen and Grace?
Carmen was too scared to stay at the house,
so I put them up at a motel.
Oh. Well, you can tell
them everything's fine.
They can come home now.
Gaby...
you just made fools out of
a U.S. government agency.
Our house isn't safe anymore.
Carmen and Grace are leaving
for Texas in the morning.
Isn't this romantic?
Like I said, I wanted this
to be a special night for the two of us. Mm.
Son of a bitch.
Well, hey, you two.
Richard, hi! What are you doing here?
I thought if Keith were bringing
a great cook like you here,
it's gotta be good.
So I thought I'd order some takeout.
Takeout. Good idea.
Yeah.
I thought maybe I'd, uh...
take the food home and
eat in front of the tv.
Of course, it is Friday.
There's probably nothing on.
So I... guess I'll just eat over the sink.
Well, uh, Richard, if you don't have plans,
would you like to join us?
Of course he has plans.
Didn't you hear about the sink?
I would love to. Let me get another chair.
What are you doing?
The man is clearly in pain.
It's not your responsibility
to cheer him up.
When he is tired of being alone,
he will meet somebody.
Maybe sooner than you think.
Tracy, I cannot get over how great you look.
What is your secret?
Revenge.
After I lost the weight,
I took a picture of myself naked
and sent it to my ex to rub his face in it...
or to be sure that he can't rub his face in.
Am I right?
You know, Richard, speaking of...
Tracy here has an incredible singing voice.
Oh, really?
Yes, we met in church choir.
Didn't you say you sang
in your church choir?
Still do. I love it.
Yeah, I don't sing anymore...
Or believe in God.
Really?
Yeah, it's kind of hard
to believe in a higher power
when you're on your knees
begging for help for
your nightmare of a life,
and you get squat!
So, yes, that's how we met... the choir.
Well, Tracy, not that God needs defending,
but as someone who's been in combat,
I have found my faith to be
a comfort in difficult times.
Isn't that refreshing?
A man with old-fashioned values.
I think we should cut all
funding to the military
and pour it into the schools.
I hope they'll teach
arabic in those schools.
So shall we order?
Bree, can I talk to you for a sec?
"Shall we order?"
Are you not sitting at that table?
This plan of yours isn't working.
I admit, she was much nicer
when she was fat.
Look, you need to get them out of here.
I have to talk to you
about something really important.
What is it?
I can't just blurt it out.
It needs to be done just right.
Hey! Did anyone order a shrimp cocktail
with a puny engagement ring on the side?
Oh, crap!
Keith, what is that?
No, no, no. Forget you ever saw this.
But, Keith...
I don't wanna hear your answer, Bree.
This is not how this is happening.
You never should have
invited him to stay here.
You ruined this entire thing.
And-and so did you, and so did you!
Well, he certainly killed the evening.
So on Sunday, I make a big roast chicken,
then on Monday,
I turn that into chicken salad,
and on Tuesday, chicken soup.
It's amazing how you can
stretch a simple chicken.
Into a 45-minute story.
When you said you were
the fun one on the Lane,
who was your competition... the mailbox?
I was just trying to cheer you up.
Well, who said I need cheering up?
Well...
I saw you crying yesterday.
For God sake. This is a pity dinner?
No. I just... I know what
you're going through.
Birthdays are hard,
especially when you're single.
But I guarantee you
you're going to meet someone.
You're a very attractive woman.
You think that's what I was crying about?
Hey. You find me attractive?
Yes.
Would you wanna go out with me?
Yeah. But we have to be very discreet,
because my girlfriend...
See? I have no problem getting a guy.
Ugh. So why the sob-fest?
Do we really have to talk about this?
No. On Wednesday, I made chicken potpie...
Okay, okay.
Here's why I was crying...
I was thinking about this...
great guy from my past.
Oh.
It was over 20 years ago.
We only had one... weekend together, but...
the way he made me feel...
and the older I get, I keep thinking that...
he was the one...
and I let him slip away.
Well, that... that doesn't sound like you.
There was someone else in the picture.
Listen...
we never know what's going to happen.
I mean, Mike and I had
our share of setbacks.
But I never gave up.
I never stopped dreaming
that maybe one day...
it would work out.
And neither should you.
You know what, Susan?
I just figured out your thing.
You aren't the fun one.
You're the smart one.
Oh.
Oh, you're good. I'll give you that.
It speaks.
Just when I think you can't find
new ways to embarrass me,
you top yourself. Well done, nutcracker!
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait a minute.
We were having a discussion
about the future of our community,
and you attacked me
and turned it into
a referendum about your manhood.
You know, I wish I didn't have to do that,
but I'm tired of all of our friends
thinkin' that I'm just a buffoon!
Buffoon?! Are you insane?
Every woman on
this street constantly tells me
that I have the perfect husband.
They do not.
They do! Gaby says that she wishes Carlos
was thoughtful like you.
Susan wishes Mike had your sense of humor.
Bree says she's never seen a better dad.
Then why do you sound annoyed by that?
How many people go up to you
and tell you you have the perfect wife?
Take your time.
Well...
Uh, lots.
Oh, wrong. I know how our friends see us...
you're the hardworking,
nice guy, and I am the bitch.
I am the one who's constantly
emasculating her husband.
I'm the one who can't wait
to get away from her kids
and go back to work.
No. People don't say that.
See? You are so nice,
you can't even tell me the truth.
For almost 20 years,
all I've heard is how incredibly lucky I am
to have a guy like you.
So if I don't constantly
brag about how great you are,
it's only because I don't wanna be reminded
of how much I don't deserve you.
You know, I'm the one
who should be bragging to all the neighbors,
telling them how lucky
I am to be married to a woman
who's still... sexy as all get out...
who makes me laugh...
and whose heart is so big,
that even after raising five children...
she still cries when she has
to pack away the last onesie.
I didn't cry.
Okay, I teared up a bit.
You know what I'm in the mood to do?
I have an idea. Hmm.
It did everything but
tap me on the shoulder.
And that's how you get out
of payin' for a taxi.
Well, we weren't in a taxi.
We were in my car.
But now I know why you showed me your boobs.
Okay, that's a lot of stairs.
How does sleeping on the couch sound?
You know something?
I told Lynette you were
this mousy little loser.
Actually, you told that to me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
'Cause I really like you now. You're nice...
much nicer than that Susan.
Okay.
Nighty-night.
You gonna be okay?
Mm, I thought I was.
I thought I could live down
the street from him,
but it's so hard.
Wait. The guy you're in love with...
He lives here?
Yeah.
Tom.
Tom?
Tom Scavo?
Yeah.
Oh, the love of my life.
Hey, Richard. I was looking
for Keith. Is he here?
No, he went for a walk.
You wanna wait for him?
If you don't mind.
I am so sorry that I ruined your evening.
Well, to be fair, you had some help.
Still, if I had any idea
he was gonna propose...
No one was more surprised than me.
This is none of my business,
but if he'd pulled it off,
what would you have said?
Speaking as your prospective
father-in-law, of course.
Um... I don't know.
It's all a little... sudden.
Yeah, that's Keith.
He's always been an impulsive kid.
Never really thinks things through.
Well, actually, his spontaneity
is one of the things I love about him.
Can I be honest with you?
I... would never...
put you and Keith together.
Oh?
Yeah, I see you with someone...
steady. More...
reliable.
Someone who shares your faith,
your old-fashioned values.
Someone more your own age?
Well, that being said,
I really do love your son.
Oh, hey, I-I love him, too.
Like I said, he's a great kid.
I should go.
Really?
Please tell him that I stopped by.
It's been so wonderful getting to know you.
You, too, Mrs. Solis.
What are you doing?
Memorizing your face.
Texas is far away,
and I don't know when
I'm gonna see you again.
Maybe someday.
Yeah, maybe someday.
Can I tell you something, Grace?
I grew up just like you.
I didn't have a lot of pretty things.
But I never let that stop me
from going after any dream I wanted.
So you remember that, okay?
Okay.
Gaby...
They need to go.
Oh, I wish you could stay with us.
Gaby...
Oh. Okay.
I'm sorry about what I said
about Juanita the other day.
Don't worry about it.
We should go.
Carmen...
Thank you.
Thank you for taking care of my baby.
Thank you for taking care of mine.
Oh, God.
Hey, everybody quiet down.
This shouldn't take too long.
We only have one order of
business on the agenda tonight,
and that is the new halfway house...
that is scheduled to open in the property
owned by Paul Young...
So let's jump right to the vote.
All those opposed to the halfway house?
Madame chairwoman? Point of order.
According to our bylaws,
we have to have a 48-hour
notice before a vote.
We'll still vote the same way in two days,
and you'll still lose.
Yeah, that'll be 14 to 1.
Then we'll take another vote to
kick you off the street.
That'll be 14 to 1, too.
You might wanna check your math.
I have at least seven votes.
How do you figure that?
With the acquisition of Mr. Scully's place,
I now own seven houses on Wisteria Lane.
What?
I used the settlement I got
from my wrongful incarceration
to acquire the extra property.
Didn't I, Lee?
You knew about this?
He was my realtor.
Couldn't have done it without him.
He just hired me. I didn't know he was evil.
How much money did you make
from these deals, anyway?
Not that much.
So that's why you tried to buy my house.
You never told us about that.
Well, I made it pretty clear
how I felt about his offer.
Well, none of this matters.
Seven houses isn't enough to win the vote.
That's an excellent point, Gaby.
I need one more.
And since this halfway house
means a lot to me,
I intend to get it.
Well, we're not gonna sell to you.
I don't need all of you to sell, just one.
So if you're sure it won't happen,
there won't be a problem.
But if someone should sell...
you'll have hardened
criminals on this street.
And what do you think that
will do to your property values?
Oh, my God.
You can't scare us.
Well, maybe not you, Carlos. You're rich.
But what about, uh, Mitzi Kinsky?
What about me?
We all know you've been laid off.
I can offer you well above market value.
Or you, Mrs. McCluskey?
I bet your entire life savings
is tied up in your home.
And, Susan, my offer still stands.
We all know Mike had to go to Alaska
because of your financial problems.
But if you lose half
the equity in your house,
will he ever be able to come back?
How much above market value?
Mitzi!
Look, I don't wanna sell,
but if somebody else does, I'm screwed!
No one else is gonna sell.
We have to stick together.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What's with all the whispering?
This is private. Do you mind?
Yes, I do. We're all waiting for
you to tell Paul to shove it.
We're just trying to figure
out how to handle this.
There is nothing to figure out.
Hey, moneybags, don't yell at her!
This is exactly what he's trying to do!
I am not yelling.
I am simply trying to explain...
He's trying to turn
the whole Lane against...
What the hell were you thinking?
Well, I didn't know what he was up to.
You sold him seven houses.
You didn't think that was a little strange?
This is not his fault,
so just back the hell off.
Okay, guys. Come on, everybody. Calm down.
We're not gonna let you destroy this street.
I don't have to.
You're going to do it yourselves.
It's a question we all ask ourselves...
do I trust the people who live next door?
Will that couple across the street
be there when I need them?
Can I count on the woman
who lives down the block?
Yes, good neighbors are
people we can rely on.
But if we discover
our neighbors can't be trusted,
then it may be...
time to move.

Previously on Desperate Housewives...
I was thinking about this
great guy from my past.
An evening of drinking
led to a confession.
Tom.   Tom scavo?
Love of my life.
I have to talk to you about
something really important.
Did anyone order a shrimp cocktail
with a puny engagement
ring on the side?
Keith's plan to propose was thwarted.
I really do love your son.
Yeah, I see you with someone...
more your own age.
What are you doing?
Memorizing your face.
Gaby said good-bye to her
biological daughter Grace.
A halfway house for
convicts on our street?
I now own seven
houses on Wisteria Lane.
And Paul needed one more house...
I can offer you well
above market value.
How much above market value?
We have to stick together.
to achieve his goal.
We know what they look like.

Corrected by Ichiban the Ninja! -
(fixed long lines etc.)
We know how they dress...
And we know how they behave.
Yes, we can all recognize
the wrong kind of people.
And when we see them coming,
we do what we have
to to protect ourselves.
Lynette!
How are you this fine day?
Who are these people?
Old friends.
Ex-con friends?
Uh... aren't you jumping the gun?
Until the homeowners association votes,
you don't have
approval for your project.
These men have volunteered to
get my halfway house ready.
Most of them live in a
dreadful facility on skid row.
I told them that if they
participated in the remodel,
I could get them transferred here.
You're wasting their time,
because this place is
never going to open.
Oh, I think it will.
And won't it be nice for
these men to live on a street
where children play
in their front yards
and people don't
lock their doors at night?
Why is Paul so sure
the house will open?
He doesn't have the votes.
He's got something up his sleeve.
What it is I don't know.
Are we positive no one's
planning on selling him their home?
We can't take anyone for granted.
We need to talk to
everyone on the street.
Good idea.
We'll shore up support.
And if we sense
anyone starting to waver...
How could they?
Everyone knows what's at stake here.
I pray they do.
I love this neighborhood,
and I don't want it to change.
Let's go.
And with that,
my friends went to work
trying to stop Paul Young.
He knew what they were up to.
But he didn't care.
He should have.
Paul had forgotten what
ordinary men and women
will do to protect themselves...
from the wrong kind of people.
It was just before
sunrise on Wisteria Lane...
when a cab arrived...
and a woman departed.
She left the street quietly.
But news of her disappearance
would soon spread.
And the sound would be deafening.
But first...
A young man in love
had plans to make
some noise of his own.
Bree, I love you,
and I want this to be
the last morning you wake
up without me next to you.
6:00! How long have
you been kneeling there?
I don't know,
but after you answer this question,
you're gonna need to help me up.
Bree...
Will you do me the honor...
May I say something first?
After that embarrassing
night in the restaurant,
I really appreciate you taking
another stab at this, but...
That's a long "But."
I'm getting up.
Hold on. I'm not saying no...
Exactly.
It's just so soon to
be talking about marriage.
Maybe I can use this
as a tiny napkin ring.
Wait!
I have a proposal for you.
I love you, too,
Keith Watson,
and I also want this to be
the last morning I wake up
without you next to me.
So I'm asking you,
will you do me the honor of...
moving in with me?
For the third time, no.
I'm not gonna sell
my house to Paul Young.
I'm sorry. I just
had to make sure.
The vote is today.
Do you really think that I
would let dangerous ex-cons
move in next to my own mother?
I don't know.
As a teenager,
you were pretty nasty.
But you're all grown up
now and so very nice.
Thank you for your support.
Excuse me.
Lynette Scavo?
Yeah?
Brent Ferguson, president
of the Hydrangea Circle
Homeowners association.
We've all heard
about your situation.
We'd love to help.
Really?  Sure.
Last year we had a similar
scare on our street.
Some old hippie wanted to
open up a drug rehab center
on our block.
I remember.
Didn't that old hippie
get beat up by a neighbor?
He made the mistake
of mouthing off
to one of my neighbors
who's an ex-green beret.
Newspaper made it sound
way worse than it was.
Well, nice to meet you.
You say the word,
and I will have
the homeowners association
of ten different streets
here to back you folks up.
Whoever's trying to
open up this halfway house,
we could really scare
the hell out of them.
Well, I appreciate your offer,
but I think we'd prefer
to handle our situation
in a more...
civilized manner.
Okay. Well,
you change your mind,
you know where to find me.
"Hydrangea Circle," Got it.
So we're at dinner,
and Renee is going on
and on about this guy
she once had a fling with
and she still has feelings for.
And she gets so drunk that
she tells me it was Tom Scavo.
What am I supposed to do with that?
You look so hot right now.
Mike, focus.
I know you've been
in Alaska for a month.
A month, 19 days, and 7 hours.
Yesterday I put boobs on a snowman.
I need to come home.
I miss you, too.
So am I making
too much out of this?
I mean, it happened 20 years ago,
And Tom's a good guy, right?
Yeah, he is, but...
Even good guys make mistakes
if the circumstances are right.
Interesting point.
Wish you hadn't made it
while you were 2,000 miles
away and clearly horny.
Susan, I am in
the middle of nowhere.
The only female
I've seen has antlers.
So should I tell Lynette?
Well, not just yet.
Maybe just keep an
eye on the situation.
Thanks for the advice.
Just so you know,
when you come home,
I'm gonna make you forget
all about that snowman.
Her name is Carol.
Okay, you really
need to come home.
Mommy?
Why are you crying?
Oh... just...
having a sad day.
You've been having
a lot of sad days.
Is it because Grace left?
Why would you say that?
That was when
you started being sad--
the day she went away.
No, it's just, you know...
I got really close to
that whole family, and...
I knew I was gonna
miss Carmen and Hector.
And Grace?
Why are you wearing my necklace?
I'm playing dress-up.
Not with real diamonds.
Hand it over!
Fine. Here.
Take it.
And I don't want you
playing in my room anymore.
You understand?
I liked you better
when you were crying.
Mitzi!
It's Lynette Scavo!
If you're in there,
please open up!
Hey, Lee. Hey.
You wouldn't happen to know
where Mitzi Kinsky is, would you?
No. Why would I?
I thought maybe you and Paul
convinced her to sell her house
and then stashed her away
someplace for safekeeping.
Lynette, I have
to say, I'm offended.
I have to say,
I couldn't care less.
You know...
For the millionth time, I had
no idea what he was up to!
You were his real estate agent!
You didn't think it odd--
Him buying all these
houses on one street?
He was paying me commissions.
What--what am I supposed to do?
Complain?
Maybe you didn't know,
and if Paul is voted down at
tonight's meeting, I'm sure
in time people will forget you
had anything to do with this--
I- but, Lee, if he finds
a way to open that house,
I don't think anyone on this
street will ever forgive you.
Hello?
Look out your window.
Oh, it's you. I'm hanging up now.
Look, I understand
you're annoyed with me.
I feel awful.
Well, you should.
Because of you, everyone on
this street hates me now.
That's why I'm calling.
I put you in an awful position.
I'd like to make it up to you.
And how are you gonna do that?
Well, first, you should
know that Mitzi Kinsky
agreed to sell me
her house yesterday.
What?
I suggested she leave
the lane for a while.
The taxi picked
her up this morning.
Oh, my god. So why--
why are you telling me this?
Because I have a
little proposition for you.
And given how the neighbors
feel about you these days,
I suggest you listen.
Hey, Mitzi, it's Lynette.
Um, still haven't heard from you.
I need to make sure
we're all on the same page for
tonight's meeting. Call me back.
Ay. Hey.
I know you're probably busy.
I really need to talk to somebody.
I would love to,
but the meeting's tonight.
I got a bunch of
phone calls to make.
Can't you talk to Susan or Bree?
No. It's gotta be you.
Why?
You're the only woman
I know who's lost a child.
And ever since Grace left,
I can't stop crying.
I break down at
the mall, at the market.
I'm starting to freak myself out.
I was the same way
after I lost the baby.
I finally went to a therapist.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Did it help?
It did.
In fact, she had me do
something you might want to try.
Write Grace a letter.
A letter?
You don't send it.
You just pour out your feelings.
Tell Grace how happy you
are to have found her
and how much you love her.
Trust me. After you've written it,
you'll feel so much better.
Gaby! Where are my keys?
Uh, I have them!
Wait. I'll be right down!
You're moving in together?
No one's more
surprised than I am.
So you did propose to her?
I tried. Bree said she's
not ready for that yet.
This was the compromise.
I figure we'll do this for a
while, then in a couple months
we'll start talking
about a wedding.
Yeah, I-I guess
that could happen.
You "Guess"?
It's just...
If Bree was in love with you,
seems she'd want to...
lock it down.
That's all.
Dad, I get where
she's coming from.
She just divorced a guy.
That's my point.
She's ready for some fun,
not something serious.
She may be looking
at you as a diversion.
No, Bree loves me.
This is going somewhere.
Just make sure.
If Bree's not willing to
make some sort of a commitment,
then maybe...
Dad, you're starting to piss me off.
I hope I'm wrong.
I really do.
And if I am...
You let me know when to rent
the tux for the wedding.
Okay.
Any sign of Mitzi?
Oh, not yet.
God, where could she be?
If she sold her house to Paul,
she better be on the run.
Not that it'll do any good.
I'll still hunt
her down and kill her.
Lynette? We've been
here for 20 minutes.
Don't you think
it's time you started?
Relax, Paul.
We're not taking the vote
until everyone's here.
Well, while we're waiting,
may I make an announcement?
I suppose.
May I have your attention, please?
I wanted you all to know
that the mayor of Fairview
will be here Friday
to present me with an award
for outstanding public service.
What? What?
Yes, it's--it's--
it's sort of a big deal,
and I would love it
if all of my friends would attend.
If you'd invite your enemies,
you'd get a bigger crowd.
AH, I love your sense
of humor, Mrs. McCluskey.
How we'll all miss
it after you're gone.
Hold it. Now, what kind of
public service did you do?
The halfway house, of course.
Oh, shoot.
Did--did I bury the lead?
I now have all the
votes I need to open it.
How do you have the votes?
Someone sold you their house?
Oh, yes.
We shouldn't have sold.
We should have just gone under
with the rest of the neighborhood.
Which would have been
very noble and very stupid.
Mitzi sold.
She's not gonna be around
for everybody on this street to pummel,
which means they would have
taken their anger out on you.
Didn't have a choice.
What the hell?
Mitzi, what are you doing here?
I live here.
Oh, I guess you would have noticed,
if I was a hot guy with abs.
But we thought you left.
Weirdest thing.
Get this call?
This guy says he has a
job for me in the city.
Puts me up in a nice hotel,
and then he never showed.
Huh, and I got stuck
with the minibar charges.
So, wait. You didn't sell
your house to Paul Young?
What?
Please. I'm not gonna
screw over my neighbors.
Lee?
What the hell
have you done to us?
No, I'm sorry.
Lynette is not here.
She's trying to deal with
this whole Paul Young mess.
Yes, I will have
her get back to you.
Ok-okay.
What is happening
to this neighborhood?
Some van just pulled up,
and these creepy
characters are getting out.
That is a school bus, Renee.
Those are children.
Well, I don't like the
way they're looking at me.
Can you come over and
install a dead bolt on my door?
Sure. I will be right over,
as soon as I find where
Lynette keeps the toolbox.
Great.
I have to jump in the shower.
I will leave the
key under the mat.
You know, I had to use
that key the other night.
Yeah?
Yeah. We went out,
and Renee got hammered,
so I had to take her in and put her to bed.
Well, that was nice of you.
Yeah...
And she told me
this fascinating story
about this guy that she
had a fling with 20 years ago.
W-why was that fascinating?
Well, apparently the one
weekend they spent together
ade quite an impact on her.
W-did she say any... thing...
else a-about that guy?
No, not really.
Only that his name was Tom Scavo.
Okay, look...
This happened before
Lynette and I were married.
It meant nothing.
Well, it meant something to Renee.
She's still in love with you.
She said that?
She slurred it.
Look, this is not
something I wanted to know,
but now that I do, I am
in a horrible position.
No, no, no, no, no.
You can't tell Lynette!
Sh-she would freak out!
I don't want to tell her,
but she's my best friend,
and I'm freaking out
knowing that you're at Renee's
fixing her dead bolt
while she's in the shower.
Look, this was forever ago,
and I don't feel anything for her.
A beautiful woman
who still wants you
is living 100 yards away,
and her breasts are 95 yards away.
Why do you want that temptation?
Hey, I didn't ask her to move here.
Well...
Maybe it's time
you ask her to leave.
So the whole right side
of the closet is yours,
and I emptied out the top
drawers of the bureau
for your socks and those cute
little boxer briefs you wear.
Thank you.
And after we've gotten you settled,
I want us to go
over and tell the girls.
They're going to die.
Bree van de kamp living in sin.
Come here.
What is it?
We love each other, right?
Why don't you just
go ahead and wear this?
Keith.
No, if marriage is where we're headed,
I just keep thinking,
what's the harm?
Because we're not there yet.
Look, I'm not trying to rush you,
but I need a bigger commitment
than just the top couple
drawers in your bureau.
We talked about this.
I'm not ready to make
that kind of promise.
That's a problem.
Because I don't
wanna wake up one day
and find out that I
was just some diversion
that, uh, you needed
to amuse yourself
while getting
through your divorce.
If you really
think I feel that way,
then why are you even here?
I'm--I'm starting
to wonder that myself.
Do you think us living
together is a mistake?
No. No, I think us is a mistake.
I wish we had been nicer to Paul.
I wish we had stood by
him when he was on trial.
I think about what he must
have gone through in prison,
and I understand his rage. I do.
But I won't allow him
to destroy this street.
It's not right.
Don't worry.
We will stop this son of a bitch.
That's a promise.
Hey. M.J.'s spending the
night at a friend's house,
so I don't care if this
protest goes all night.
I'm here to the bitter end.
How can I help?
We need more signs painted.
Okay.
Hey, Susan.
Look on that paper.
We came up with a whole list of slogans.
Just so you know, we got
plenty of "Think about the children,"
and we need a lot
more "Who let the cons out?"
So, what exactly are we
hoping to accomplish with all this?
The mayor is in a
close race for re-election.
He needs every vote he can get.
If we can make
a big enough stink in
front of the news cameras,
maybe we can embarrass him
into shutting that place down.
So if this protest works,
and the place doesn't open,
what happens to all those ex-cons?
What happens to them?
I mean, I-if they don't get
to stay here, where will they go?
They'll just go back
to where they came from,
or some house in
another neighborhood.
But what if that neighborhood
doesn't want them either?
I mean, if they've done their time,
and they need a second chance,
wouldn't it be better for them
to be in a nice neighborhood?
In theory, yes, but that's
not the way the world works.
We have to think about
our neighborhood, our children.
Ourselves?
Don't be cute. Some of these
men may have good intentions,
but some of them could
still be really bad guys.
But if we don't
even try to help them,
are we so sure
we're the good guys?
Richard.
Keith told me what happened.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
So, uh, why are you here?
He also mentioned all that
work that needs to be done.
In your backyard.
Luckily, I taught
him everything he knows.
Uh, wait.
Uh, you don't need to do that.
It's not a problem. I'll have
it done by the end of the week.
But if you wanna thank me,
think you could find
me something cold to drink?
Mayor Franklin.
What an honor.
Paul Young.
You must be the good samaritan.
I've heard so much about.
This is my wife Beth.
I've never met a celebrity before.
Well, now you have.
The media will
be arriving shortly,
as well as some of
the mayor's supporters.
Uh, with the election
just a few days away,
we thought this could
be a terrific photo op.
No problem.
While you're waiting, would
you like a tour of the facility?
Absolutely.
I must say, I don't know
how you got your neighbors
to agree to a halfway
house on their street,
but they must think a lot of you.
Honestly, this is all happening
because of what I think of them.
Richard? Is that you?
The lemonade's not quite ready yet.
Richard, would you
like a sandwich with that--
Who are you?
This the halfway house?
Uh, no. That's next door.
So I guess we're
gonna be neighbors.
Well, I'm sure you're in a hurry
to get settled in over there, so...
I'm in no hurry.
What's going on in here?
Uh, this, um, gentleman just,
uh, wandered into my home.
I made a mistake.
Won't happen again.
It better not.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, I was just,
uh, taken by surprise.
You're shaking.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
No, really... really,
I'm fine, just, um...
Thank you for taking care of that.
What are you doing?
Something I've wanted
to do for a long time.
You're gonna have to leave.
Okay.
Maybe I misread some signals.
There have been no signals.
I was dating your son.
Okay.
If that's the way you feel,
then I'll finish
up out back and go.
I want you to leave now.
Look, I made an error in judgment.
I'm--I'm sorry.
Please let me finish the work.
I said now.
I will leave when I'm finished.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, here we are.
Well, here's trouble.
Bunch of geeks with
"Vote Franklin" Signs
just showed up.
Looks like we're outnumbered now.
Oh, I'm not worried.
Who the hell are they?
The cavalry.
Hey, guys. Guys!
I'm not too late, am I?
Nope.
You're just in time.
Oh, yeah.
Okay!
Here's the plan.
Once the mayor begins his speech,
I'll give the signal.
That's when we all begin chanting, okay?
You got it?
All right!
Let's go!
We need to talk now.
Quite a turnout.
Look at those news cameras.
Uh, do I need a little base?
Hi-def is killing me.
Hey, Franklin!
Where did all
these people come from?
I don't know.
But it looks like things are
about to get very interesting.
No, no, no!
How did she find out?
You told her the other night!
Oh, while we were drinking.
You were drinking.
She was listening!
Oh, my god.
Yeah, this is bad.
What else did you say to her?
I mean, she thinks that you
still have feelings for me.
Oh, well, that's just... ridiculous.
She's not gonna say
anything to Lynette, is she?
No.
Does she want you to tell Lynette?
No, she had a different suggestion.
And I think it's a good one.
I'm going outside
to watch the protest.
Stay in your room and
look after your sister.
Oh! Don't get into
those cookies I made.
Those are for after supper,
and yes, I counted them.
Juanita, what's wrong?
What is that?
The letter you wrote to grace.
Okay.
Okay.
Honey, you really
shouldn't have read this...
'cause it doesn't mean anything.
Grace is your daughter, isn't she?
That's why you've been
crying since she left.
You love her more than me.
No. No, no, no!
That is not true.
You are the most important
thing in this world to me.
You believe mommy, don't you?
You're not my mommy.
Juanita!
Come back here!
Juanita!
Juanita!
Juanita!
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Mayor Harold Franklin!
Save our street!
Save our street! Save our street!
Save our street! Save our street!
Save our street! Save our street!
Save our street!
Good afternoon, everybody.
It's a pleasure and
an honor to be here...
I thought you said the
neighborhood was behind this.
Did I?
I appear to have been wrong.
...with a troubled past that's
is in their neighborhood.
Save our street! Save our street!
...inventory of compassionate,
understanding people!
If I ever get my hands on
Paul Young, I will kill him.
Can we talk about
this in the hotel?
There's a lot of
angry people out there.
I know.
Save our street! Save our street!
Your actions are a blueprint
for others to emulate.
And that certainly describes
the people who live here...
on Wisteria Lane.
Hey! I talked to tom.
This is not the right
time to discuss this.
Save our street!
Hey, we are discussing it.
Tom told me about your
little, uh, suggestion
that I need to move off the lane.
And I want you to know,
that ain't gonna happen.
You know, if you were
really Lynette's friend,
You would know that you
cannot live two doors down
from her husband--
a man you still love.
That is none of your damn business.
Really?
'cause I am lynette's friend,
and I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you
screw up her marriage.
So help me, susan--
Hey, get your hands off me.
Save our street! Save our street!
Save our street! Save our street!
Save our street! Save our street!
I'm parked three blocks away.
It's crazy out here.
Did you finish up everything?
Oh, yeah. I'm done.
...blueprint for others to emulate.
Because the only
way we're gonna have...
Hey. I got your message.
What's wrong?
I think you should know
there's been an
incident with your father.
Save our street! Save our street!
In particular, there is
one man, Paul Young...
Th-though he was
unfairly incarcerated,
he has chosen...
Carlos! I can't find juanita.
You let her outside
with all this going on?
No, she ran away!
She found out about grace!
How?
Look, I'll tell you later.
Just help me find her!
Juanita!
Juanita, where are you?
Juanita!
Juanita!
Can't I go back and get it?
It's not that important, lee.
She signed that program
after her concert at Carnegie Hall.
She was a drug addict.
Let it go.
Can you move, please?!
Come on!
You son of a bitch.
Come here.
What's wrong with you?
Look, I made a mistake, okay?
Hey, don't push me.
Hey, one of those cons
is beating up a guy.
Get him!
Keith! What are you doing?
Come on!
Get him!
Save our street!
...through his generosity.
He has chosen not
to be angry or bitter...
Get off of him!
And I'm honored to
present this medallion
to a man...
And in conclusion,
love thy neighbor!
Susan!
Listen to me!
If you don't care about my life,
think about what
you're doing to Lynette!
I am thinking about Lynette!
This would destroy her!
Get off of him!
Juanita!
You're pushing!
Susan.
Stop pushing!
Susan!
Susan!
Go around them!
Go around!
I can't!
There's people everywhere!
Maybe we should
go back in the house.
Please don't leave me.
Hey! Frank, wait! Wait!
What the hell are you doing?!
I'm gonna make sure this
halfway house never opens.
Oh, my god!
This is what you want, isn't it?
No, no!
Not like this!
Give me the bat!
Please!
You know what?
You go hang out with
the rest of the kiddies.
Frank! Frank, wait!
Lynette! Lynette!
Help me, please.
Oh! Mrs. Mccluskey!
Oh, my god! I've got you!
I got you.
Just drive. They'll move.
Hey! It's them! The ones that sold!
Oh, crap!
Renee! Renee, get off of there!
I'm looking for susan!
It's not safe!
Get down!
I saw her fall!
I think she's hurt!
Get out of the car! Now!
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Help!
Juanita!
Mommy!
Get off! Get off!
Give her to me!
Give her to me!
Mommy!
Come here. Come here.
Paul! Paul!
Go inside, darling.
This is all on you!
I hope you know that!
Me? Those are your friends
out there, Lynette--
The solid citizens of fairview.
Tell me again
Why you think they're better
than a bunch of ex-cons?
Stop!
Stop it! Leave him alone!
Leave him alone! Stop!
He's my neighbor!
stop it!
Take him over!
Get him over here!
Come on!
Somebody help!
Thank you.
It was just before
sunrise on Wisteria Lane.
You could no longer hear
the screams of
frightened bystanders...
or the angry
chanting of protestors...
or the cries for
help from the injured.
There were just
the footsteps of a man
who had finally punished
those who had betrayed him.
The silence was broken
by something the
neighbors would later say...
sounded like a gunshot.
But paul knew
it was the sound of revenge.
Previously on
Desperate Housewives...
Will you do me the honor
of moving in with me?
Proposals were made.
I think starting an interior
design business is...
It's genius.
Juanita learned the truth.
You're not my mommy.
She told me about this guy
that she had a fling with.
Susan revealed she knew a secret.
His name was Tom Scavo.
That was none of
your damn business.
I am Lynette's friend,
and I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you screw
up her marriage.
Help!  And when a neighborhood
protest got violent...
Juanita! Get off the car!
Juanita was saved...
Susan was hurt...
And later, someone...
Got revenge.
Something happened
in the suburbs last night.
A man was shot outside his home.
Detectives were
called to investigate.
And they soon learned
this man had enemies.
Detectives, I'm an expert marksman.
If I'd been aiming for Paul Young,
he'd be dead.
I have no idea who shot Paul.
All I know is I need a chiropractor
for all the cartwheels
I've been doing.
If you find out who did it,
let me know.
I want to send them flowers.
Yes, the police had many suspects
in the shooting of Paul Young.
But his wife...
Had only one.
I was surprised you
wanted to see me.
Our last visit ended less than...
pleasantly.
Are you here to apologize?
You know exactly why I'm here.
No, I don't.
Obviously, you didn't
do it yourself.
So who did you hire?
Beth, I don't know what
you're talking about.
Paul's been shot.
What?
Is he dead?
No.
Sorry. He's in the hospital.
When did this happen?
Oh, stop it, mama.
Just stop it. I know you had
something to do with this.
Beth, you have to believe me.
I-I don't know anything about it.
You're a liar.
Look, I'm not going to pretend
I don't hate the man. I do.
But my goal all along
has been to prove
that he murdered my sister.
Why would I have him killed
before I could do that?
Then who shot him?
I don't know.
I don't know what
to believe anymore.
I have to go to the hospital.
Word on the yard is that you
can get me a clean cell phone.
For a price.
Get it.
Somebody's been a naughty boy.
I guess you changed your mind
about that proposal I made.
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I'm thrilled.
I just wish you'd waited
till I gave you the signal.
Yes, Paul Young had enemies.
I can't talk right n.
More than he knew.
It's something we
need to be reminded of
whenever our world has
been turned upside down.
Come the morning, life goes on.
We pull ourselves together
and go on shopping sprees...
Or reignite a love affair...
Or go back to work.
Yes, we must remember
life will get better...
Unless it doesn't.
You took out my kidney?
It had ruptured.
You were bleeding internally.
We had no choice.
Oh, my God.
But you can get by
on one kidney, right?
Usually. But in your case,
it's a little more complicated.
The other one is deformed.
Well, fine. I won't enter it
in any kidney beauty contests.
The point is, it's only
operating at about 5%.
If that number drops any lower,
you're at serious
risk of renal failure.
How do I not know this?
I-I've never had any
serious health problems.
That's because the other kidney
was doing such a great job
of taking up the slack.
You mean the one you took?
Yes.
So what are you saying?
Do I need a transplant?
Eventually. But we need
to get you on dialysis.
That requires a minor
surgical procedure
to install an A.V. shunt,
going...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
Y-you said if it goes any lower.
Maybe it won't. Maybe it'll go up.
Anything is possible.
But you need to come to terms
with the reality of
what's happened to you.
Your life has changed.
I have some information
here on dialysis.
I suggest you read it...
Today.
Welcome to Miss Charlotte's
Doll Academy.
I'm Miss Charlotte.
How can I serve you today?
We are here to buy a doll.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We don't sell dolls here.
Really?
Wow. This place got creepy fast.
But I do let good little girls
adopt some of my friends.
Are you ready to be a mommy?
I don't care.
Oh, she's kidding.
She would love a doll,
and I want to do
something special for her birthday.
So let's get this adoption going.
Very good. I have someone
in our royalty cabinet
I'd love for you to meet.
Look, I am sorry about
everything you've been through
the past few days.
But I'm trying to show
you how much I love you.
Can't you meet me halfway?
This is Lady Catherine.
She's the toast of
Buckingham Palace.
The trim on her cloak
is real ermine.
Ooh! Isn't she gorgeous?
Wow.
I'll go prepare her papers.
Are you happy, sweetie?
Yeah!
Oh. Let me get my phone out
so I can take a picture
of my two princesses.
Why are you looking at Grace?
O-oh, I wasn't. I was, uh...
I must have scrolled too far.
Why do you even have that picture?
And what name shall I
put under "mother"?
Put whatever you want.
I hate this stupid place.
Oh...
Juanita!
Juanita, wait!
Susan, hi.
I heard about your kidney.
And I just want you
to know I have two.
So let's talk deal.
Relax. I'm not telling Lynette.
You're not?
Thing about having something
like this happen to you...
You start to think about what's
important and what's not.
And I realized it's not
up to me to tell Lynette
about something that
happened 20 years ago.
Oh. Thank God.
Hey.
Y-you okay?
You've been standing out here for,
like, 20 minutes.
I saw Susan at the hospital.
How's she doing?
She's not gonna tell Lynette
about our 20-year-old mistake.
Oh, thank God.
What a relief!
W-why aren't you relieved?
There's one thing she said
I can't get out of my head.
If I never tell
Lynette what happened,
then my friendship
with her is not real.
Sure it's real. Ugh.
All my life, people I thought
were my friends have left me.
People from college,
friends I had with Doug...
They're all gone.
And Lynette stayed.
I think I owe her the truth.
No. No, no, no, no, no!
Sometimes being a friend
requires you to lie.
I mean, come on.
We've all seen McCluskey
in those jogging shorts
and yelled, "lookin' good!"
That's being a friend.
Renee...
You can't tell Lynette.
She would be devastated.
I know.
I just have to live with
what that says about me.
Great. We got a plan.
Thought you might want a cold
root beer to cool you down.
I like the "cold" and "beer" part.
I know living with a
woman who doesn't drink...
It must be torture.
How's the replanting coming?
It's taking a little while.
Yard got pretty
messed up by the riot.
I'll work on the sprinklers later.
There's no rush.
Ah, look who's drinking
out of the bottle.
See what you've done to me?
The next thing you know,
I'll be flossing only once a day.
Hey. You started
unpacking my stuff?
Yes. Your, uh,
books are on the shelf.
Sports trophies are in the den.
And on a sad note, your beanbag
chair accidentally ripped
when I stuck a knife in it
and stuffed it in the trash.
Hmm. My lava lamp?
Accidentally broke when I
pushed it off the counter.
Man, my stuff is clumsy.
I may not love all your things,
but I love that you're here.
Everything that happened
over the last few days
made me realize how
important you are to me.
Mm! Whew!
Steer manure's not your
favorite aphrodisiac?
It's only slightly worse
than your aftershave,
which accidentally got
poured down the drain.
Well, hold your breath.
I'm kissing you anyway.
There is a God.
Mm. Can I help you?
Someone to see you.
Orson.
Judy kicked me out.
Can I stay here with you?
I never saw it coming.
One minute, Judy and I were
enjoying a nice Pinot Noir,
and the next, she was
wheeling me to the cab,
and telling me it was over.
That's terrible.
Well, don't you worry.
You can stay here with us.
Are you sure?
I mean, I had no idea that Keith
had just moved in with you.
I mean, you're a new couple.
The last thing you need around here
is a third and... fourth wheel.
Nonsense. We insist.
Stay as long as you want.
Isn't that right, Keith?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Any idea how long that might... be?
I just want to know how long
we'll be enjoying his company.
I gather as soon as I can
find a new place to live
and a caregiver.
Would you mind backing up a bit?
Your cologne is
making my eyes water.
Actually, it's steer manure.
To each his own.
Uh, Keith, why don't you go shower?
And I'll, uh, get Orson settled.
Would you like some tea?
Mm, no. I'm fine.
So...
Keith.
Interesting choice.
Just... sort of happened.
Hmm.
But moving in together?
I mean, aren't you taking
this rebound relationship
a little too seriously?
It's not a rebound relationship.
What Keith and I have
is very... special.
And I know what you're thinking.
He is a bit young.
Oh, no. Not at all. I notice he
has all of his big boy teeth.
But he and I have a lot in common.
Really?
Hmm.
I'm just... curious.
Which Lil Wayne song
is your favorite?
"Fo Sheezy" or "Ask Them Hoes"?
Joke if you must, but I am
not the woman you once knew.
I have changed,
and Keith is responsible.
What I'm wondering is
why would someone change
something that was already perfect?
God, I never thought we'd
have a kid in therapy.
Well, I did. I just
thought it'd be Celia.
I wish we weren't doing this.
You know the shrink
always blames the mother.
The husband blames the mother, too.
How many times do I
have to say I'm sorry?
You know what?
It is not about us anymore.
Juanita's world is
collapsing around her,
and the only thing that I care
about is healing the damage
that's been done to
that poor little girl.
I took her doll shopping.
Juanita, if you'd like to
go through the magazines,
I'll talk to your mom
and dad for a minute.
Okay.
Okay? Please.
Obviously, this is a very...
Unusual situation.
Juanita understands now
that her birth parents
are Hector and Carmen.
But she feels nothing for them.
And because of that,
she doesn't understand
why you feel so much for Grace.
Well, it's a different
kind of love.
It doesn't mean we
love Juanita any less.
What should we do?
Remove Grace from your life.
We told you. She's already gone.
Juanita says there
are photos of her.
Her artwork is on
your refrigerator.
You're saying get rid of all that.
Yes. Once Juanita
feels she is again
the most important
thing in your life,
she will start to heal.
Well, obviously,
I want to help my daughter.
But all the photos?
We'll do whatever it takes.
Good.
So we canvassed your neighborhood
to determine if
anyone had any motive.
And, uh...
They all did.
Yes. But so far,
all of them have an alibi.
So... what's the next step?
Well, we'd like to ask Mrs. Young
a few questions.
What kind of questions?
Well, for starters, we'd like
to know where exactly you were
when your husband was shot, and...
I'm gonna stop you right there.
My wife is not a suspect
in this investigation.
She is the one person
in that whole corrupt,
backstabbing street
that I can trust.
Okay. Uh...
Is there anyone else who might
harbor a grudge against you
or wish you harm in any way?
Not that I can think of.
What about you, Mrs. Young?
No.
No one I can think of.
Well, then, uh,
if you can think of anyone,
please let us know.
Did you catch the look
on the wife's face?
Yeah.
Gaby!
What?
What are these photos of
Grace still doing here?
Oh. Right. Sorry.
You should have gotten rid of these
the second we got back
from the doctor's.
I've been busy.
Here, give them to me.
What are you gonna do with them?
Hide them in the closet.
No. We have to throw these away.
Why?
Juanita could find them.
She and Celia play in
your closet all the time.
Fine. I'll put them in
our safety deposit box.
The girls don't play at the bank.
Why are you not
taking this seriously?
Dr. Lunt never said
we had to throw Grace's
photos in the trash.
The doctor said we have to
remove Grace from our lives.
You understand what that means?
As far as we are concerned,
Grace no longer exists.
Now give me your phone, please.
Why?
I'm going to delete
every photo of Grace.
Oh, you can't be serious.
Juanita is in pain!
Do you not get that?!
She is no longer a
happy little girl
because you did not protect her!
So what am I supposed to do?
Just pretend Grace doesn't exist?
Yes! And that is the last time
you will mention her
name in this house!
Oh, please, no more meds.
I'm good for what ails ya.
Mike! Oh!
Oh...
Oh! Oh!
Oh, I need to look at you.
No, I need to hug you.
How's my girl? Hmm?
Hear you're about a
half-pound lighter.
They told you about the kidney?
Yeah. But it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get through this.
Dialysis is not as
bad as it sounds.
I'm not doing dialysis.
What? It's like six hours a day,
four times a week.
There's not enough
gossip rags in the world
to fill up that kind of time.
Plus, I have a job
and a kid to raise.
But the doctor said...
Mike, you know what?
The doctors...
They don't know everything.
Look at this. There's herbal
remedies and alternative diets.
There's a lot of other
ways to handle this
than being hooked up to a machine.
Mike, I-I feel great.
And I just want to
handle this my own way.
Well, I'd feel a lot better
if you'd listen to the doctors.
And I'd feel a lot better
if I had your support.
Okay.
God, I can't believe you're back.
So the overall
approach is craftsman,
but with Japanese accents,
including the lighting....
The vases, the calligraphy.
The two styles...
Work perfectly together.
And for your hotel,
we think it would look...
Just gorgeous.
Well, I usually run
everything past my board...
But not this time.
I love it.
And I love the way you
two are so in sync.
Well, we should be. We've been
best friends for 25 years.
Well, actually, uh, 26. Oh.
You can tell.
So, let's see what you have
in mind for the lighting.
You guys keep talking.
I'm gonna go get the water pitcher,
'cause the waiter
won't refill my glass.
So... the lighting.
Uh, yeah, I have a company
that does these
Japanese paper lanterns.
Mm. They're beautiful.
And you know we have other hotels.
So we may need some
more conversations.
Hey. Look what I found next to
the water pitcher. Tee... ta-da!
Oatmeal raisin.
She's always been crazy about them.
Remember freshman year, when you
broke up with that boyfriend?
I kept her on a steady
diet of these and tequila
for two weeks.
The bar is one of
my favorite areas.
Those lanterns with these...
Are you okay?
It's just, uh...
Oatmeal raisin.
Yeah?
You've been such a
good friend to me.
Hey...
Hey, relax!
There was, like,
a hundred of 'em on a tray.
So, take the drawings home.
Live with them.
And we will check in next week.
Renee, are you...
Yeah, no, she's fine. She's fine.
And we'll call you next week.
And thank you so much.
We are so excited.
What the hell?
I have to tell you something.
20 years ago...
I did something awful.
God, who cares?
Ten minutes ago,
you did something amazing.
I slept with Tom.
When?
It was that weekend you
went to visit your parents.
And it was just the one time,
and it meant nothing.
And I've been carrying this around
ever since I moved here.
And it's been eating me up.
That was after we were engaged.
Yeah, but you had... broken up...
For the week.
God, I'm so sorry.
I don't want to hear it.
In fact, I can't even
look at you right now.
I can't even...
Be in the same room
as you right now.
But you are my ride, so let's go.
Do you hate me?
Shut up.
Lynette, I just need to...
Shut up.
Yes.
I hate you...
A lot.
But I do foresee a
day far in the future
when I might only
hate you a little.
You know what the worst part is?
For the last 20 years,
you two have been walking
around knowing this, and...
I...
Didn't.
I'm such an idiot.
You're not, you're not.
And I am so sorry...
Oh, my God, you really
need to stop saying that.
But I do need you to do me a favor.
Anything.
Don't tell Tom we
talked about this.
Why?
You slept with my husband.
Can we just leave it at
"'cause I said so"?
* Happy birthday to you *
* Happy birthday to you *
* Happy birthday, dear Juanita *
* Happy birthday to you *
Yay!
Hi. We haven't met yet.
I'm Tina's mother.
Juanita came to our
house last week.
Oh, right. Thanks for coming.
Of course.
Mom.
I know. You want some cake.
Hold on. We'll get you some.
Sorry. That's my youngest, Celia.
Oh, she's adorable.
Do you have any other children?
No.
I don't have any other children.
I am finally home.
And just so you know,
I had the worst day ever.
Did you?
Yeah, I-I-I had to meet with
one surly client after another.
Our computers went down.
I spilled coffee on my shoe.
Sounds like you went through a lot.
But I'm much better now.
Oh, m...
Oh, oh, oh, God!
Uh, I forgot to ask...
How did the pitch go?
Good. We got the job.
That is fantastic!
Oh, my God. You guys are
just getting started,
and you're already kicking ass!
I am so proud of you!
Well, it was mostly Renee.
She did the lion's
share of the work.
She's an amazing woman.
Yeah.
Everything okay?
Yes, of course. I, um...
That sounds great.
Yeah? Might be a little cold.
Do you want me to heat it up?
No. It's okay.
Mm!
Aah!
It's... it's... it's boiling!
Is it?
I-I-I burned my tongue!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here we are.
Oh, Bree, you didn't.
Coq au vin?
Well, I know it's your favorite,
and considering the rough
few days you've had...
You are amazing.
Hello.
Oh, good, you're here.
We can eat.
What that? I thought, uh,
we were having sloppy joes.
Oh... uh, well...
Since we're having a guest,
I thought I'd serve
something more elegant.
You know what?
Tomorrow night, you and I
should make our bouillabaisse.
Of course.
Oh, Keith, you'll love it.
If it's French for "sloppy joes,"
then have at it.
Bree, this looks wonderful.
Mm.
If I may.
"Show me another
pleasure like dinner
which comes every day
and lasts an hour."
Talleyrand.
"Shut up and eat, varmints!"
Yosemite Sam.
Well, this is quite a thrill.
I didn't know Stanley Kowalski
was joining us for dinner.
Is he a friend of you guys?
Um, actually, um...
It's a character in
"A Streetcar Named Desire."
He wore a lot of t-shirts and...
Because Will Ferrell
hasn't done a remake.
Um...
Sweetheart, why don't you
go up and put a shirt on?
After all, it is dinner,
and we do have company.
If it's all the same to everyone,
I'm comfortable,
so I'd like to stay in this.
Why don't I just go
up and grab you one?
It will only take a sec.
Bree, sit.
Please. I'm sure our company can
endure one night of bare arms.
Quite right. Though I don't
know what the fuss is.
Seems like such a
reasonable request.
Guess I just like dressing
the way I want to dress
in my own home.
Here's an idea.
Why don't you take off your jacket,
see how much more comfortable it is?
Well, if it's all the same to you,
I'd prefer not to.
Aren't you afraid of
getting food on it?
Not really.
I'm planning on eating with
utensils, not my hands.
Keith.
Whoops.
Accidents happen.
Well, I suppose I should be happy
it wasn't his own feces.
Orson, I'm so sorry.
Keith, what were you thinking?
Let's just put this
behind us, shall we?
And enjoy the lovely meal
that you've prepared.
Oh, and please pass the peas.
Stop it this instant!
You're acting like children,
and I will not stand for it!
Do you hear me?!
Ahh!
Ohh!
Bree.
Hi, Judy. I'm sorry to just
come over here without calling,
but I need to speak with you.
Come in.
How's Orson?
You know he's, um, staying with me?
Figured as much.
Well, I need a favor.
It's, uh, just too difficult
for Orson to live with
me and my new boyfriend,
and I know you broke
up with him, but...
Is there any way he could stay
here until he finds a new place?
Look, I don't know what
he's been telling you,
but Orson left me.
What? Why?
Because he's still
in love with you.
Beautiful, isn't she?
Oh.
She's just perfect.
I'll take her.
I must say, your daughter's
a lucky little girl.
My daughter?
I assumed you were
buying her a present.
Oh, no.
This is for me.
Hey.
I'm really sorry about last night.
But there is something
about your ex...
Keith... I get it.
You had a relationship,
it's over, it's totally platonic,
and I'm cool with it.
Actually, I just spoke
with his ex-girlfriend.
Orson is still in love with me.
I knew it. I knew it.
Let's wheel his ass
to the curb right now.
Keith, Keith, calm down.
Before we wheel his...
Anywhere, I need to talk to him.
I'm sure I can get him to
make other arrangements.
Well, get him to make 'em now.
I don't want that guy in
our home another night.
Fine. Just give me 15 minutes.
I spoke with Judy.
She told me that you
were the one who left...
Because you still
have feelings for me.
Is that true? Is that...
Why you're here?
Leaving you was the biggest
mistake I could have made.
I know that now.
Orson...
Tell me you don't
feel the same way.
Just tell me you feel nothing,
and I will go away. I promise.
Do you know how easy it
would be for me to...
Become that woman again?
To slide back into the
role of your wife?
Then do it.
We have a connection,
Bree, and you know it.
We used to.
But I've made a new connection.
Please, with that
tattooed Neanderthal?
Yes, and I will always
have feelings for you,
but I've... changed.
How have you changed?
I... I can't articulate it to you
because I don't
understand it myself.
All I know is that being with Keith
has made me a different person.
I don't believe it.
Orson...
You will always have
a piece of my heart,
but you have to understand
that this is over.
I'm not giving up.
I'm not.
So?
Did you tell him?
Does he need help
packing his stuff?
Um... actually, Orson's gonna be
staying with us a little longer.
What?
Just, um, for a few more days
until he finds a place of his own.
Please? He's very
fragile right now.
I don't believe this.
Well, I can't just throw him out.
You know why?
Because you don't want to.
I don't blame you.
It's not your fault you're
still in love with him.
What?!
Wait! Please stop and talk to me!
Bree, there's nothing
to talk about!
Why would you wanna
be with sloppy Joe
when you can be with
coq au vin in there?
Let's just cut our losses.
You listen to me.
That's who I was, not who I am now.
I have never worked harder in
my life to keep a relationship,
and if I have to in a
pile of steer manure
to prove it to you,
then I'll do it!
Mmm.
Mike, just hang up.
I don't wanna deal
with any more doctors.
He's a top kidney specialist.
I really want you to talk to him.
I can't get any reception in here.
I'm gonna go downstairs. M.J.,
take care of your mom.
Mom, this pudding's gross.
I wish they had ice cream.
Well, I think they do in
the cafeteria downstairs.
When your dad comes back,
maybe he can take you.
How much longer are you
gonna be in the hospital?
I don't know. A little longer.
Is a kidney like a heart?
Do you need it to live?
Uh, well... yes.
So... you could die?
You know what?
Why don't you and I go down
to the cafeteria
right now and get
you some ice cream?
Mrs. Delfino,
you're in no condition
to be getting out of bed.
Just taking him for ice cream.
Let me at least call you an orderly
and get you a wheelchair.
I don't need a wheelchair.
Look, I need to do this.
He's scared.
So how long till you're able
to play basketball with me?
Oh, not too long.
Trust me, sweetie.
I can't wait to kick your butt
in a little game of one-on-one.
Oh!
Are you okay?
Sure.
So, what... what kind of ice
cream do you want, sweetie?
Can I have an ice cream sandwich?
Oh. You bet.
You know what's cool?
When I was at my friend
Jerry's birthday party,
we made our own ice cream and
put graham crackers in it.
That sounds... great.
Oh. You know what else was cool?
On St. Patrick's Day at school,
they gave us green ice cream.
There were green M&M's in it, too.
Everyone else thought it was gross.
Mommy!
So you're having surgery
to put in a shunt.
It's for the dialysis.
And how long will you
need to have this?
Till they find me a donor.
Well, that won't take
very long, will it?
Three to five years.
It's weird.
I'm going through this whole
thing like it was a movie.
It was happening to someone else.
But now...
It's real.
So I need to ask
you guys something.
Of course.
What is it?
If something happens to me...
I need to know if you'll be there
to help... Mike with M.J.
Honey, you'll come through
this with flying colors.
Yeah, nothing's
gonna happen to you.
Absolutely.
Yes. We'll be there.
My hero.
Save it. I had nothing
to do with what happened.
Could you do me a favor next time?
A little down... and to the right.
There's not gonna be a next time.
There wasn't a this time.
I thought you said
you'd think about it.
That's what you said,
and I told you "no."
I didn't do it.
Then who did?
Something happened in
the suburbs last week.
A man was shot outside his home.
Detectives were called
to investigate...
And they soon learned
this man had enemies...
Some he was not even aware of.
We're sorry to disturb
you again, sir.
Not at all. Any luck
with the investigation?
Is your wife here?
She's in the cafeteria.
Do you mind? It's a bit
of a delicate matter.
What's going on?
Sir, when we questioned you
about any enemies you might have,
you didn't mention
your mother-in-law.
My mother-in-law?
What are you talking about?
Uh, we did a little checking
into your wife's background.
Why didn't you tell us
her mother framed you
for her own murder?
I mean, come on.
We know she's in jail,
but Felicia Tillman has gone
to some extraordinary lengths
to cause you harm.
Are you sure there
isn't a possibility
that she somehow was
involved in this?
Not at all. That's
water under the bridge.
With love and prayer,
Felicia and I have resolved
the issues between us.
Okay. If anything else turns up,
we'll let you know.
I appreciate it.
Oh, and, officers?
Thank you for not bringing
this up in front of my wife.
Her mother is something that
we never really discuss.

Previously on...
The riot left victims in its wake.
Do I need a transplant?
You need to come to terms with the
reality of what's happened to you.
We'd like to know where exactly
you were when your husband was shot.
My wife is the one person on that
backstabbing street that I can trust.
So what am I supposed to do,just pretend grace doesn't exist?
Yes!
Gaby's biological daughter was
erased,and she struggled to cope.
I slept with tom.
And lynette learned the truth.
Tom scavo had a
20-year-old secret.
He had once slept with
his wife's best friend.
Tom felt it no longer mattered.
But his wife,who had just
learned this secret...
Felt differently.
That's why she had
decided to punish him...
And torture him...
And humiliate him.
Lynette planned to tell
her husband she knew.
But first,she was determined...
To have her revenge.
What are my keys doing on the floor?
Did my pants just...Rip?
Yeah.You might wanna go up and change.
Wow.Thank god I wasn't going commando.
I'm sorry you had to see that.
Is that a seam ripper?
Could be.I don't really sew.
Did you do something to tom's pants?
Lynette.
It's just a thing I do whenever I find
out he slept with one of my friends.
Ugh!I knew I shouldn't
have told you about us.
But you did.
So this is how you're
getting back at him?
Isn't it a little immature?
My rage needs an outlet.
And you got to admit,it beats
smashing his head in with a 9-iron.
Well,there is another option.
You could tell him you
know and deal with it.
No.
Well,why not?
Because then he'll tell
me he's sorry,and I'll cry,
and he'll cry,and then I'll get over it.
And I'm not ready to get over it.
I have a lot of anger to work through before
we sweep this under the carpet and move on,
so please don't tell him what I'm doing.
But,lynette,it
come on.
It's not like anybody's getting hurt.
Tom!Are you okay?
Yeah.I slipped on something.
Peanut butter?
What...
How Those damn kids.
Yes,lynette scavo had
developed a taste for revenge.
And she was finding it delicious.

Desperate
housewives Season 7 Episode 12</font>
We pass by these people every day.
We sense their isolation...
But we just keep walking...
Telling ourselves there's
nothing we can do to help...
Which we know is a lie.
Hello,reverend.Wonderful sermon today.
Thank you,bree.Do you have a moment?
I need to talk to you about something.
Sure.
One of our parishioners is
going through a personal crisis.
She's in desperate need of
a friend-someone to talk to.
And you thought of me?I'm flattered.
So you wouldn't mind reaching
out to this lost lamb?
Oh,you are the very
milk of human kindness.
Now,stop.I'm happy to help.
Unless you're talking about beth young,
in which case i'd rather shave my
head and join the hare krishnas.
Bree!
I'm sorry,but she is married to the biggest lunatic in fairview.
He tried to destroy our neighborhood,and
she did nothing to stop him.
Still,the christian thing
is to offer her solace.
After all,"let him who is
without sin cast the first stone.
" John,chapter 8,verse 7.
What about,"the righteous will
be glad when they are avenged,
when they bathe their feet
in the blood of the wicked"?
Psalm 56,verse 10.
"if you do not forgive others their
sins,your father will not forgive yours.
" Matthew,chapter 6,verse 15.
"whoever does not obey the laws of god must
surely be punished by death or banishment.
" Ezra,chapter 7,verse 26.
"bree van de kamp is shacking
up with her boyfriend.
" Cynthia thomas,pew 5,seat 7.
Fine.I'll talk to her.
But this is spiritual blackmail!
I'm a man of god,bree.
I do what it takes to get the job done.
Everything's delicious,gaby.
Thank you.I'm glad you guys could come.
You know us.We never turn
down a champagne brunch.
Who said anything about champagne?
I did.Come on,people!We
need some bubbly!
We gotta celebrate!
Celebrate what?
you
Okay,it's kind of a long story.
It all started last year.
We're adopting a child.
You were killing the moment.
Meet liza hunter-mcdermott.
Liza?
Guess who lost that coin toss.
She's beautiful.
There was a 2-year wait for a baby.
But we found this orphanage
that had lots of older kids.
So we figured,why not?
She's 10 years old.And if all
goes well,she's ours next month.
Well,we're really happy
for you guys.Aren't we,gaby?
Gaby,what's wrong?
Uh,nothing.
I'm thrilled for you.Really.
Oh,honey. We didn't even think
With everything you've been going through
she's fine.
It's just...I don't even
know where grace is,or...
How she is,or when I'm gonna see her again.
Gaby.
We didn't mean to upset you guys.
It's fine.
She's gone,and now gaby
and I are moving on.
And we've agreed not to talk
about it because it is so painful.
I'm sure you understand.
Of course.
So,please,tell us more about
your little girl.What is she like?
Uh,you're gonna love her.
I mean,she's so smart and so funny.
The first time we walked in that
room,there was this instant connection.
We just knew she was ours.
You know what?We should
make a toast to little liza.
I'm gonna get that champagne.
Look who I found.
Julie!
What are you doing here?
I told you not to fly home.
Oh,mom.Haven't you learned I
don't listen to a word you say?
Besides,they won't let
you mail a major organ.
Oh,no.
No,don't even think about
it.You are not gonna be my donor.
I did tons of research.
They have these new surgical techniques.
It's no worse than a belly piercing...
Which I did not do.
You know,the doctor did say that blood
relatives are your best chance for a match.
Honey,you are not going through the
rest of your life with only one kidney.
But,mom-
No.
I'm going on the wait list.
That could take years.
You know,there is another option.
Somebody who's close to you
that loves you very much.
We've been through this.
You're not the right blood type.
I meant your mother.
My mother?
Mike,I already lost my kidney.
Now you want me to lose
my mind?No,no,no,no.
We are not asking her for a kidney.No.
In fact,we're not even
telling her about this.
We're not?
Of course not.
Uh-if she heard one word
about this Oh,my god.
Julie,what did you do?
I'm sorry.
I
You're hurt.I thought you'd want her to know.
And,uh...She'll be here tomorrow.
Oh,my god!
i
I've gotta get out of here.
Unhook me.Unhook me!
No,no.Susan,this is good.
You need a kidney,she's got a kidney...
That I will be paying
for the rest of my life!
"how come you haven't visited?
I gave you my kidney.
why won't you friend me on facebook?
I gave you my kidney. No.
This is a nightmare.
You owe me,julie-big.
You're right.
How about I give you a kidney?
Bigger than that.
Don't react.
Good not reacting.
What the hell are you doing back there?
I can't let her see me talking to you.
who?
Lynette.She knows.
Knows what?A-about us?
How?
Who cares how?The
point is,she found out.
Why hasn't she said anything to me?
Oh,she's saying it
Your pants splitting open,falling down the stairs
Haven't you noticed you've been
a little accident-prone lately?
That was her?
So she's responsible for my flat tire?
The sardines in my gym bag?
yep.
The gay porn in my
powerpoint presentation?
Her proudest moment.
So she's just gonna
keep on screwing with me?
I mean,what else has she got planned?
I don't know,but she is one angry woman.
Be careful.God knows
what she'll do next.
What the hell are you doing?
Testing the brakes before
I get on the highway.
Hi!
I-I haven't seen you out in a while,
so I thought I'd stop by
and see how you were doing.
What do you really want?
Well,I talked to
reverend sykes yesterday,
and he tells me that you've been
going through kind of a rough patch.
Come on in.
You know,growing up,I didn't
really have a lot of friends.
We weren't a very...Social family.
But I was never hated.
Nobody hates you.
But they hate my husband...
Don't they?
I just wish people could understand him.
He is not a bad man.
It's just,his life
has been so difficult.
He went to prison for a
murder he didn't commit.
His wife killed herself.
His son hates him.
He's been through a lot.
Well,I may not be able to
convince people to like paul,
but there's no reason you
should suffer for what he's done.
I am having the girls over this week,
and I think it would be
wonderful if you'd join us.
That's very sweet.
But I think we both know those
women aren't gonna want me there.
Those women are my dear friends.
Trust me.They'll be fine with it.
And if they're not?
Well,then I'll just have to
twist some very dear arms.
Okay,Mrs.Delfino.You're all hooked up.
Where's my daughter?They
said she was down here.
Do you see her?
Oh,god.
Are you in pain?
No,but I will be.
Oh!Susan.
mom.
Oh,my poor,sick baby.
Hello,mike.
Oh,honey.
I have a surprise for you.
One of your favorite things from home.
Get in here!
Aunt claire.
She figured I was cheaper than flowers.
Uh,mike,you haven't met my aunt.
Uh,she taught me how to make
a manhattan when I was 8.
I had her up to old fashioneds
by the time she was 12-
And that's a difficult drink.
She's like the bartender I never had.
So,sweetheart,your mother tells
me you have a deformed kidney.
I told her not to sleep on her side.
Well,we're hoping to
find a donor very soon.
Oh.Wouldn't that be nice?
I wonder who it'll be.
You read all these stories-
Strangers brought together through
life-threatening circumstances.
Our best bet is a
match within the family.
oh!Like julie!
no.
m.j.
He's 9,mom.
You don't take a kidney
out of a 9-year-old.
Well,it'd take care of that
bed-wetting problem,though,wouldn't it?
You know,we were
actually thinking that...
You might be a possible donor,sophie.
What do you mean,"oh"?
Well,it-it's-it's
just...It-it's...
I can't believe this.
She's not gonna do it.
Of course,she wants to.
It's...It's just the timing of things.
Morty and I are about
to take a cruise...
For three months.
A cruise?
Nonrefundable.
And you won't even get tested.
You know,we haven't even
checked in at the hotel yet.
Uh,why don't we do that?
Yes,okay.
We'll be back in an hour or two.
And if you're better,if you feel
like it,maybe we'll take you shopping.
Actually,I'm having my blood
washed for the next six hours.
But go!You two have fun.
I've been workin' on the railroad just to
pass the time awayjust to pass the time away
hey there
Perfect timing.
I made your favorite
Double fudge brownies.
Well,I had a big lunch,and I don't
want any more pants ripping,so...
No,thanks.
What are you talking
about?You look great.
Have one.It won't kill ya.
Yeah.Maybe later.
Are you sure?
They're tasty.
Ooh.Brownies.Can I have one?
Uh...No.
Yeah.Sure,penny,have one.
no!I mean...
I don't want her to spoil her dinner.
Besides,I made these for your dad.
Oh,I can share.
Here,penny.
Take it.
Eat it.
no!
You guys are weird.
What'd you put in there
Cayenne pepper?
Drain cleaner?
So renee told you.I am gonna kill her.
Let's get back to how
you're trying to kill me!
don't you dare act like
the injured party here.
You betrayed me!You had an affair!
It wasn't an affair!
It was completely meaningless!
It was after we were engaged!
No,we had broken up,remember?
No,no,we were taking a break,remember?
Yes,we were fighting constantly,so we
decided to spend some time apart to decide
whether we were gonna
get married or split up.
Right!
So I went to my mom's house to think
about it,and I will never forget this.
I was sitting in the kitchen.
My mom was making a frittata.
And I thought,"oh,I should make
that for tom," and then it hit me.
There might be no tom.
I might never see you again.
And I had an epiphany.
I didn't want a life without you in it.
Yeah.I was at a crossroads,and I
chose the path that included you,
and you know what kills me?
While I was making that
decision,you were off...
Sleeping with my best friend.
That was fun.
I've been kind of
down lately,and,well...
Nothing like a little retail therapy.
Yes,I'd say you had a real breakthrough
around the fourth shoe store.
Please tell me carlos isn't having
an affair with a tiny naked person.
Celia!Juanita!
Oh,my god!What the hell are you doing?
Playing with my new doll.
Look,she can leap off cliffs.
No,no!
This is not your doll!
Then whose is it?I
found it in your closet.
Oh,my god.Where's her
arm?Where's her arm?
ohh.For god sakes.
Celia,this is not a toy!
Yeah,it is.
No!It's not!
It's something special
that belongs to me!
it is mine,and no one
can take it away from me!
i'm sorry.I couldn't help overhearing.
Is everything okay in here?
Mommy's mad because we
played with her doll.
Go to your room.
Go!Both!
Your doll?
of course it's not mine.It's...
A gift for bob and lee.
They're adopting a little girl.
Let me get your discharge papers,and
I'll be back to wheel you out.
Thank you.
Hey,uh,mike's bringing
the car around front.
I will,uh,get your bag.
Hey,what is that on your
arm?Did you get a blood test?
I just...Wanted to see
I am not taking your kidney.
Relax.I wasn't a match.
But if I was and I didn't check,
I never would've forgiven myself.
Come here.
You know...
When you were growing up,sometimes
I felt like I was just winging it.
And then I see the incredible
woman you've become,
and I know I did something right.
Wh-where's my
daughter?Did they move her?
I'm telling you,it's the
other end of the hall.
I'm here!
Hello,sweetie.
What are you doing?
Well,you're getting discharged
today,and I came to help.
Let me take that bag.
No.I wouldn't want you to pull something
and not be able to play
shuffleboard on your cruise.
Well...How about I take us
all out for a nice lunch?
I can't.I'm on a restricted diet,
and m.j. Is waiting for me at home.
I'd like to be there for my child.
Come on.Let's go.
Let me at least push your chair.
I'm good.
Susie,I want to help.
You do not get to "help"
by pushing my wheelchair.
You had your chance to help.
Susan,be fair.
no!
How could you refuse to even be tested?
My own mother!
Julie couldn't wait to hand
over one of her kidneys.
Well,there you go.Problem solved.
I wasn't a match.
That is not the point.
You only had a 15%
chance of being a match.
That meant there was an 85% chance that I'd
never know how little you cared about me.
I could've gone the rest of my life
thinking you were a wonderful mother
who had the wrong kind of kidney.
Now wait a second here  -
No,no,no,no,claire.It's okay.
I am...
Sorry I disappointed you,honey.
hey.
Can we talk for a minute?
That depends. Are you alone?
Yes.
Then we can talk. You wanna come in?
That depends. Do you have beer?
Yes.
Then I'll come in.
I,uh,I need a favor.
I want you to let your mom off the hook.
No way.
I'm-i'm done with her.
Susan,there are some...
Things you don't know.
Like what?
What could you possibly tell me
that would excuse her behavior?
I'm her daughter.
This is my hour of need,and
she's not even trying to help.
No. I'm not gonna
forgive her for this,ever.
She has cancer.
What?
Breast cancer.
They caught it early,and...
We'll see how it goes.
She's starting chemo next week.
Well,what about the cruise?
That is the cruise.
That's the story we're telling
because she didn't want you to know.
And that's why... She
can't give you a kidney.
Why wouldn't she tell me? This
doesn't make sense. You know mom.
I mean,since when has she
passed up a chance for attention?
ecxactly,***
She decided no,not this time.
She wasn't gonna burden you.
And I jumped all over her.
I gotta go talk to her.
No,no. Don't tell her you know.
Why not?
Susan,please.
Respect what she's trying to do here.
She's trying to make up for a
lifetime of "me,me,me. " Let her.
Oh,dear. This is why people should
never let children play with dolls.
But don't worry.
I'll have princess valerie all sewn up
and good as new by the end of the day.
Thank you so much.
Can I ask you something?
Of course.
Am I... Weird for being
so attached to a doll?
I only bought her because
I thought she was beautiful,
and she reminded me of
someone,but lately...
I'm starting to feel like I need her.
She... Calms me down when I get
upset,and I enjoy spending time with her.
The thought of leaving here
without her is really upsetting.
That's crazy,right?
Come with me.
You know,what you've been
feeling is absolutely normal.
Well,tell that to my friend bree.
I was holding that doll,and she
looked at me like I was insane.
Most people will never
understand,but I do.
Let me introduce you to
someone. This is Mrs. Humphries.
I saw her in a window in a tiny
shop in ohio and fell in love,
and the more time we spent together,the
more I got to know her story.
Her story?
Of course. Every doll has a
story,and it turns out Mrs.Humphries
started her own
business,just like I did.
She has a music shop,and
she teaches piano.
And she... Told you that?
Gaby,dolls don't talk.
But even so,mrs. Humphries
is always there for me.
You see,her sister passed away
around the same time mine did.
Ever since... She's
brought me such happiness.
Isn't it... Funny how
a doll can do that?
And the best thing
is,they'll never leave you.
So... What's your doll's story?
I don't know.
Oh,of course you do. Tell me.
Her... Name is princess
valerie. She's a princess.
But she wasn't always one.
Really?
When she was born,there was a mix-up,and
she was given to the wrong family.
Nobody knew for a long time.
but one day,she find way to home.
From that day on,princess
valerie never left the palace.
Her real mother kept her hidden
away so no one would take her.
And they were never separated...
Ever again.
I know I'm not sleeping in here tonight.
I am unbelievably sorry about this.
I
I wanted to tell you so many times,but...
I
I could never find the right moment. It...
Really?
In 20 years of marriage,there was never
a lull in the conversation for you to say,
"hey,guess who I slept with"?
When would have been a good time?
The day I found out you were
pregnant with porter and preston?
Parker's 1st birthday party?
The morning that penny
took her first steps?
We have had... Such
beautiful moments together.
I
I didn't wanna ruin a single one of them.
I hope you can forgive me for this.
It would be a shame...
A shame if some meaningless encounter
20 years ago ruined this wonderful life
that we have built together.
Susan.
I'm sorry I didn't call first.
You're not busy,are you?
I'm just packing. Uh,my
cab's gonna be here soon.
So... Y-you have time to talk?
Sure.
I,um... Well,I just... Wanted
to apologize for yesterday.
Oh. No need. This is...
A horrible time for you,and
you've got so much on your mind.
It's
It's not that horrible,and the doctors are very optimistic that we're going to find a donor.
I'm not worried.
I'm so relieved.
You know what the one good thing
about having a health scare is?
No.
What?
Makes you think about what
the important things are.
That's very true.
We all think that we're...
Gonna be here forever,that we have...
All the time in the world to say
the important things,but we don't.
Why don't you and I ever
tell each other how we feel?
We don't need to.
We know how we feel.
Do we?
You're right.
You already know how much I love you.
And you already know that
anytime I accomplish anything,
you're the first person I wanna
call,'cause I love making you proud.
And you know that...
No matter how much you make me crazy...
Part of me enjoys it because it reminds
me that nobody else has a mom like you.
Yeah. I don't have to tell you that.
Just like I don't need to tell you that
my life began the day you were born.
And it's been such a happy one.
Aren't we lucky we
already know those things?
yes? Yes. I'll be right down.
It's my cab.
You go,and i,uh...
I'll call you later.
Okay.
You know,one of these days,I would
I would like for us to take a little trip,
just the two of us.
Oh,I'd like that.
You know,we'll go someplace hot and
just lay out and drink some daiquiris.
Oh,we'll... Absolutely do that.
Just as soon as I'm done with my cruise.
Yeah.
No offense,penny,but soccer's boring.
Yeah,it's as boring as...
Actually,there's nothing more boring.
You can tell us about it later.
But you have to go.
It's a playoff game.
They're the best team in the league.
I need your support.
Oh,who cares? You guys suck anyway.
Yeah,they may suck,but they still
would've beaten parker's team.
Hey,preston,uh,how did the
baseball team do senior year?
Shut up. At least I played.
That's true. Remember that
time he struck out five times?
By the third time,the
crowd started laughing.
Yeah,that was hilarious.
Your last at-bat,the other
team sat on their mitts.
Oh,so embarrassing.
Shameful.
Come on,you guys. Please?
I got stuff to do.
Like what?
Stare in the mirror and wait
for the first mustache hair?
Relax,penny.
At least you won't have to share
your snacks with us after the game.
Okay,fine. Don't go.
We're just messing with you.
We're going.
Thank you.
I'm even gonna drive you,but I'm gonna
warn you,if you lose,you're walking home.
Oh,please.
Yeah. I'm not driving losers in my car.
Does that mean you're
not taking preston?
Here you go,ladies.
Oh,bree,that looks amazing.
Thank you so much for
putting this together.
It really feels like old times.
Well,you have been through so much,
and I wanted you to feel loved and
embraced by all the people in this room.
And while I'm on the
topic of embracing people,
I have invited our
neighbor beth to join us.
Cheese puff,anyone?
Beth young?
Married to paul young?
The lady with the bad hair?
Oh,forget the hair! Her
husband caused the riot.
Which caused susan a kidney.
Why would you do this,bree?
I just felt sorry for her.
The poor woman has been shunned
by everyone in this neighborhood.
Because she's married to a monster.
so? Why should she have to suffer
for the sins of her husband?
Oh,crap. She's been talking to a priest.
Renee,help us out. Tell her she's crazy.
Uh,actually,i'm with bree.
Please,you've never given beth a chance,and
speaking as the other new kid on the block,
you guys are like the mean,pretty girls who
won't let anyone sit at your lunch table.
That is so unfair.
Who invited her?
Okay,that's beth.
Now,please,ladies,make an effort for me.
I'm actually excited.
I always wanted to be one
of the mean,pretty girls.
Yeah,I got a delivery for van de kamp.
Ooh,how lovely.
I don't see a card. Who are they from?
Uh,beats me.
Must be my boyfriend.
Would you mind setting them over there?
I'll go get a tip.
Is it her,or can I wipe
this fake smile off my face?
It's a deliveryman.
Someone sent me flowers.
Was it the pope?
Here you go. Thank you.
Oh,good! You made it.
Hello.
Ladies,beth's here!
You're sure this is okay?
It isn't gonna be awkward?
Of course not! The girls
are delighted you're here.
We are going to have a wonderful time.
That is a really good deal on potting soil.
yes.
Well,again,I had a coupon.
That is fortunate.
Maybe I should go.
no,no,the evening has just gotten started.
I'm gonna need some help in the kitchen
You,you,you,and you. now.
By the way,I know somebody who can really help you with that hair.
Renee!
What is wrong with you people?
You said you'd make an effort.
I am making an effort
An effort not to tear out my deformed kidney
and cram it down her throat.
Yeah,so beth's feeling a
little lonely these days.
Why is it our responsibility
to make her feel loved?
Okay,look,I didn't wanna bring this
up,but let's talk about the last woman
who was married to paul young
A woman who was in pain,and we ignored it.
Do we really want beth
to end up like mary alice?
We're back.
We've decided to kick
this party up a notch.
Lovely.
Yeah. Sit here.
We'll pour you some vino.
Thank you.
Is red okay? Because we have white,too.
Uh,no,red is fine.
What in the world?
Somebody lose a gun?
Oh,my god. What is that doing there?
Bree?
No,I keep all my weapons in
a locker. Let me see that.
It's a. 38 caliber.
The police said... Paul
was shot with a. 38.
I think I finally understand
why you invited me over.
Meaning?
I'm just thinking how convenient it is
A gun
that may have been used to
shoot paul was under my pillow?
A
and now has my fingerprints on it?
Hey,I was sitting there before
you were,and I didn't feel any gun.
Yeah,speaking of convenient...
You're alone in the room,we came back,and
suddenly there's a gun under the cushion?
Where would I get a gun?
Oh,I don't know.
How about the one you pointed
at me on halloween night?
You never told us that.
You mean the night you broke into my house
and tried to kill my husband with a club?
You never told us that,either.
I'm allowed to have a private life.
The point is,she owns a gun just
like the one that magically appeared
when she was alone in the room.
You're all in on this.
You wanted to set me up.
I can't believe you would say to
that to me after I reached out to you.
Well,I think it's time I did
some reaching out of my own.
I'm calling the police.
We don't have to get up early tomorrow.
So I was thinking...
Maybe we could
I still cannot believe that I fell for beth's act.
Or we could talk about this some more.
Well,she is just as twisted as that
husband of hers,and I am a fool.
You're not a fool.
You're a kind and generous person.
That's what I love about you.
That and the fact
that you can go from...
Mad to passionate in a heartbeat.
I suppose you do deserve some loving...
After those beautiful
flowers you sent me.
At the risk of... Going
to bed frustrated...
I didn't send you any flowers.
You didn't? Then where
did they come from?
We pass by these people every
day,but we never look at them.
We don't wanna see the
sadness in their expressions...
The longing in their hearts...
The loneliness in their eyes...
But there are times we should stop
and look at these isolated people.
Why?
well,if we look close enough...
We might just recognize them.
Previously on Desperate Housewives
Keith moved in with Bree.
Susan came to grips with her future.
Dialysis until they find me a donor.
Well, that won't take very long, will it?
Three to five years.
In grief over losing
her biological daughter...
Grace no longer exists,
and that is the last time
you will mention
her name in this house!
Gaby sought comfort
from an unusual source.
And there were some surprises...
somebody lose a gun?
Including a long lost son...
You didn't mention your mother-in-law.
My mother-in-law?
And a shocking revelation for Paul.
Felicia Tillman has gone
to some extraordinary lengths
to cause you harm.
Paul young had made a discovery--
His wife was a liar.
She had lied with every smile,
with every caress,
and with every kiss.
Yes, Paul now knew their
entire marriage was a fraud.
The only thing he didn't know...
Hey there.
was how he would punish her.
You're packing?
I thought you weren't
coming home until tomorrow.
I talked the doctor
into letting me out early.
I'm glad. I really need you right now.
Things on the street have
been getting very strange.
Beth, things on that street
have always been very strange.
Well, yes, but...
Remember I told you how
Bree was inviting me over
for drinks with the other women?
And I told you not to go.
Well, I should've listened.
Turns out they're trying to frame me.
Frame you?
While I was there,
I found a gun under my sofa cushion.
It was a .38--
The same caliber the police
said you were shot with.
They must've planted it there.
And the gun just magically appeared?
Yes.
I'm sure Bree's going to
turn it over to the police,
And they're going to think I shot you.
Beth...
You don't have to worry
about what anyone else thinks.
I know the truth.
Hey, here's an idea.
Why don't we take a trip?
A trip?
We need to get away.
We'll go somewhere... secluded.
That sounds like heaven.
Yes...
Paul had no choice
but to punish his wife...
I love you.
Because some lies...
are unforgiveable.
We are reminded every spring...
with every rose that blooms,
with every sunflower that blossoms,
with every lily that buds.
The world is a beautiful place.
Sadly, it is filled with
people who do ugly things...
Constantly.
That woman who just drove away...
Who was she?
Uh... A friend.
You're friends with Barbara Fairchild,
The interior designer?
Bob?
Or should I say, the inferior designer?
Hey, Renee.
How could you hire Barbara Fairchild
when you know I just started
my own interior design firm?
Uh... we're not hiring her.
Oh? Why you holding swatches?
And people think you're the smart one.
Look, you know we just adopted a little girl.
Well, we hired Barbara
to decorate her room.
Well, why not hire me?
You're not exactly maternal.
We--we wanted this room
to be pink and nurturing,
And your style seems more
like chrome and glass and...
teeth.
Look who's back to being the smart one.
Look, Fairchild is a hack.
Whatever she quoted you,
I'll come in two days
earlier and 20% cheaper.
Barbara is kind of expensive.
Done.
I'll get started right away.
Just so you know,
our daughter gets here in a week.
And just so you know,
I'm as maternal as the Next Woman.
Gaby?
Hi, honey. You want some lunch?
No, I want an explanation.
I just got our credit card bill.
$840 at Miss Charlotte's Doll Academy?
Did I say lunch?
I meant sex. Do you want some sex?
Why are you buying our kids fancy toys?
Last week, Juanita used her doll's leg
to scrape peanut butter out of the jar.
Okay, the doll wasn't for Juanita.
It's for...
Bob and Lee, for the
little girl they're adopting.
You spent $800 on a gift?
It made me feel good, okay?
For the first time in weeks,
I'm not staying in bed
till 2:00 in the afternoon
or staying up all night sobbing.
So I went a little
crazy on the credit card.
Just let me be happy.
But $800?!
Carlos, if you get this worked up now,
you'll have no place to go
when the bill for the
platinum card comes in.
Uh, excuse me?
Hi.
I'm looking for Keith Watson.
His roommate told me he moved here.
Uh, yes, but he's
not available at the moment.
Can I give him a message, Miss...
Sorry. I'm Amber James.
I just need to talk
to him about something.
It's kind of important.
Well, I would be happy to
tell him what it's regarding
if you... tell me...
what it's regarding.
We're just... old friends.
I'm at the Fairview motor inn.
Could you ask him to come by?
Why exactly would he be doing that?
You're... kind of a
nosy landlady, aren't you?
I'm not his landlady.
I'm his girlfriend.
So he...
lives here with you?
Yes.
Yeah, of- of course he does.
Of course he does.
Are you all right?
Um, yeah, I'm fine.
You know what? Don't even, uh,
don't even tell him I came by.
There's no message.
Sorry to disturb you.
Okay, you're all set.
The dialysis will take six hours.
If you need anything,
just hit the call button.
Will do.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Susan.
It's my first time in here.
Dick.
Sounds like you've been
coming here for a while.
Four years.
Any tips for a newbie?
Like, which nurse has the shakes
or where do they hide
the good painkillers?
Look, nothing personal,
but I don't want to
be your dialysis buddy.
I wanna sit here and
play scrabble on my phone
while this--while this
machine washes my blood.
So you don't want to
talk or be friendly
or keep each other company?
Sad, isn't it?
You know, Dick...
Sometimes when I meet people, they say,
"You don't seem like a susan."
But you...
Why are you putting out
those ugly candlesticks?
Oh. Who gave them to me?
Yay! Grandma's coming.
Yep, and your brother
just pulled up with her.
This could be your last chance
to run screaming from the room.
Why?
I love grandma.
I do, too, sweetie. It's just...
I can only take her in small doses,
and unfortunately, your grandma
doesn't come in small doses.
Hey!
Easy over the threshold!
You're not transporting meat.
Okay, grandma, enjoy your visit.
She's going back in a cab.
Mom! Hi!
Oh, my gosh!
What happened to your foot?
Oh, I-I broke it a month ago.
Uh, thanks for checking in.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We've just been so busy, and...
Penny, look, your grandma's here.
Give her a kiss.
Hey, look at you.
You're getting buds!
Be thankful she
didn't yell it to you
as you were getting on the bus.
So... uh, what's new?
Well... actually, um, I started
an interior design business.
Do you remember my friend Renee?
I'm getting married.
What? Married?
To who?
Frank kaminski.
We met in water aerobics
at the retirement community.
Only man in the pool.
I was lucky to get him.
This is kind of a shock.
I didn't even know you were dating.
So... when's the wedding?
Saturday.
This Saturday?
Uh, and you're just telling me now?
Well, maybe if you visited
more often...
more often. I know.
I know. So...
Do I get to meet him?
I mean, if you're going to
make this kind of commitment...
What? You wanna make sure
his intentions are honorable?
Lynette, I hate to break this to you.
I am not a virgin.
Mom... I want to meet him.
All right, come by tomorrow,
and we'll squeeze you in
between "Nothing to do"
and "Waiting for death."
Are you all right?
What?
You were yelling in your sleep.
Really?
Yes, you were shouting out,
"Amber! Amber!"
What could that mean?
I'm... I'm doing a painting job.
I'm thinking about, uh...
shades of yellow
that go in the kitchen.
Nope.
Definitely not a color.
Sounded like a name--Amber.
Know anyone by that name?
I once had a girlfriend named Amber.
Did you?
And at this time
I'd like to point out
that dreaming of an old girlfriend
is not cheating.
Well... when was this?
You never told me about her.
I-I don't know.
Seven years ago?
Seven years?
Was it serious?
We lived together...
for, uh, three years.
So you were in love with her.
Well... yeah,
until she left me.
So she left you.
You miss her?
I tend to not dwell on
people who stomped on my heart.
Now if you don't mind,
I'm gonna go back to sleep
so I can dream about you.
It's so great visiting
a retirement village--
2 regular parking spaces, 48 handicapped.
Hey, mom. Mwah.
Lynette...
This is Frank.
It is so nice to meet you, Frank.
Call me "Dad."
Wouldn't it be awful
if I was that guy?
So... Frank, um, I've just
been dying to meet you, and--
Just a sec.
Hey, muchacho.
We've been waiting
ten minutes for our menu.
What do I got to do to get you
to hurry it over, build a fence?
Hey, it's a menu,
not a high school diploma.
I'm sure you can find one somewhere.
Oh, yeah. You were saying something?
Lynette's been dying to meet you.
She has so many questions.
Oh, go ahead. I got time
to kill while I'm waiting
for Pancho Villa to get my menu.
Okay. Uh... I was just wondering,
what made you decide
to propose to my mother?
I love her.
What do you think?
Aw. What a short... angry story.
Frank... is very to the point.
That's what first
attracted me to him.
Oh.
What else you need to know?
Um, have you ever
been married before?
Three times--two dead and two left me.
Oh, wait a minute. That's four.
Yeah, then make it four.
Now... you done grilling me?
Yes. I think I've learned
everything I need to know.
Hi, Gaby.
Hey, Karen.
I wanted to get the name
of that chinese place
you and Roy are always raving about.
Come on in. I'll get you the address.
Carlos is a little grumpy
since the credit card bills came in.
I figured a little M.S.G.
Should calm him down.
I've got a menu here somewhere.
I never noticed that before.
What?
That doll.
Oh, Adelaide.
Heck, I've had her since forever.
She was my best friend growing up.
I couldn't bear to
toss her, so there she is.
I didn't know you were into dolls.
I'm not really into them.
Oh! Here's the menu.
Where did, uh, that come from?
I carry her around with me.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
Her name's Princess Valerie.
Oh! Look!
They could be sisters.
Okay.
Oh, I have an idea.
Miss Charlotte's doll academy,
where I got valerie,
has this tearoom.
It is beautiful.
All of us should go sometime.
By all of us, you mean the dolls?
Of course.
Should I make a reservation?
Well... maybe.
I'm kinda curious to
see where this all goes.
Here.
Thanks.
Oh, no!
What's wrong?
I said "No mayo," Like, 15 times.
I'll trade with you.
Do you want my salad?
Uh, let me check.
Nope, still got a penis.
I want my hamburger
the way I ordered it.
I'll get you a new one.
I got tee time in ten minutes.
So go!
It'll be waiting for you at
the condo, wrapped in foil,
with an ice cold beer
when you get there.
You're- you're so good to me.
See you at the wedding, Lorraine.
So what do you think?
Well, he's quite a...
I wouldn't even know where to...
Okay, he's gone.
How can you marry that jerk?
Lynette!
I mean it.
He's abrasive,
obnoxious, borderline racist--
No, he crossed the border of racist.
He lives in racist.
You cannot seriously love him.
I don't.
You... you don't?
Then why are you marrying him?
Because he's loaded,
and he hates his kids,
and he's got a bad ticker.
And when he kicks the
bucket, I get everything.
You're marrying him for his money?
Please. I married
for love three times
and ended up brokenhearted
and piss-poor.
And by the way,
he's getting something
out of this, too.
You wanna know how I
really broke my foot?
Paul?
What are you doing up?
Is everything all right?
Couldn't sleep.
I've just been...
sitting here, thinking.
About what?
I have so much hatred inside me...
From my neighbors who betrayed me...
For my son who disowned me.
For whoever tried to kill me.
I'm tired of hating people,
But I don't know how to stop.
What a thing to say.
Stop being so hard on yourself.
You're a decent man.
You just need to focus on
what's good in your life.
What is that again?
Well, for starters, me.
I do think about you... all the time.
From the first moment I met you,
all I wanted was for you to love me.
And... here we are.
Here we are.
You're just tired.
Come back to bed.
All right.
Tomorrow we can talk about our trip.
We need to decide where we're going.
Yes, about that...
I booked us a cabin in the woods.
Cabin? Oh, that sounds... rustic.
I need to go somewhere far away
where nobody can find us.
Okay.
You can be happy, Paul.
You just need to identify
what's negative in your life...
And then get rid of it.
That sounds like a plan.
Hey, Karen.
Gaby's in the kitchen.
Actually, I wanna talk
to you about Gaby.
How's she doing lately?
Well, you know, we went
through kind of a rough patch,
but I think she's coming around now.
Yeah? Well, think again.
Girls, dinner's ready!
I made your favorite...
What are you doing here?
Gaby.
Jeez! You scared me.
This wasn't a gift for
Bob and Lee, was it?
Why'd you lie to me?
Because I knew you wouldn't understand.
You spent $800 on a doll for yourself.
Y-you're right.
I-I don't understand.
Oh, please.
Like this is any crazier
than your collections.
A steroid freak hits a
baseball over a fence,
and you paid thousands
of dollars for it.
Yeah, well, I don't
carry it around with me
or take it to tea.
Okay,first of all,
MRS. Mccluskey has a big mouth.
Second, the doll makes me happy.
What do you care?
Gaby, I want you to be happy,
But this is not about a doll.
You know what?
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
This is clearly about Grace.
No! No! No!
We're not supposed to talk about her!
That was your rule!
I'm going to get ready for dinner.
Hey, Susan.
I kept her warm for ya.
Thanks, Ethan.
Hey, how was your history final?
Aced it.
Thank you for studying with me.
No problem. I'll see you thursday.
Yeah.
Scrabble.
Look, I know you don't wanna talk,
but I thought it would be
more fun to play with me
than with your phone.
Thanks, but I'll take the phone.
You know, this whole experience
is miserable and isolating enough.
I don't understand why
you wanna make it worse
by ignoring someone who's going
through the same ordeal.
Susan, did you ever
see the old war movie
where the fresh young kid
comes in all bright-eyed,
and the old vet won't
give him the time of day?
I hate war movies.
Okay.
What about the one
where the girl moves
to a different town,
and the mean cheerleader
at her new school
doesn't wanna hang out with her?
Go on.
I'm the mean cheerleader. Okay?
And I'm letting you know we're
not going to be friends.
You know, I can see
why you're frustrated.
Waiting for a transplant is brutal.
I-I get that.
But that doesn't mean that you
can't try to stay positive
while you wait for the good news.
The good news?
When this beeper goes off,
that means someone died.
That's what we're waiting for--
for some poor son of a bitch
who didn't use a helmet
or a seat belt to die.
We're waiting for a
doctor to ask a family
who, moments earlier,
lost someone they loved
to let them harvest their organs.
And then we're waiting
to see who gets them.
That's what we do.
We wait for tragedy
and then cross our
fingers that it's us
they wake up at 2:00 in the morning
with the good news.
Susan...
I know your intentions are good,
but you don't have to distract me
or entertain me or comfort me.
I wasn't trying to comfort... you.
Hi, Amber.
What are you doing here?
Well, you seemed so
upset when you came over,
and obviously it involves Keith,
or you wouldn't have
come looking for him,
and so naturally I'm concerned.
Everything's fine.
It's not a big deal.
Anyway, I'm...
sort of in the middle of packing, so...
Mommy, I can't find my ball.
Charlie, I'll be with
you in a second, okay?
How old is Charlie?
6.
Keith and I would be
great for a while
and then not so great.
I had actually moved out
before I realized I was pregnant.
So why didn't you tell Keith?
I had actually decided
to give up the baby,
and I knew he would try
and talk me out of it.
Then I changed my mind
the moment I saw Charlie.
After that, it just never
felt right to come back
and ambush him with a kid.
And yet... here you are, ambushing.
It's just... charlie is at that age
where he's starting to
ask a lot of questions,
and I'm running out
of ways to be vague.
So charlie is the
only reason you came?
Okay.
Maybe I... was kind of wondering
if Keith would still be...
But I'm glad he's happy.
You seem really great.
I know I owe it to
Charlie to tell Keith.
It's just...
I don't think I can do it.
Would you like me to?
You would do that?
I think I have to.
Now, it's not exactly finished yet.
I'm still waiting on a few pieces,
and the curtains are on back order.
Don't worry.
I'm sure it's amazing.
But you did keep the receipts, right?
Oh, my god.
It's exactly the room I
wanted when I was growing up.
I mean, the only
thing that's missing is...
baby unicorns!
So... you like it?
Oh, we love it.
Thank you, Renee.
It's everything we'd hoped for.
How did you put this
together so quickly?
Oh, it was easy.
I've been thinking about
this room for 20 years.
Really?
There was a time when I
thought I might have kids.
I used to imagine the kind of room
I'd want my daughter to have.
Right down to the last detail.
I never knew you thought about kids.
Well, that was a long time ago.
It's never too late.
Heck, if we can adopt...
Excuse me.
I've gotta find that painter.
This is not the color
we agreed on for the trim.
I can't do it.
I can't be a party to this.
I can't wheel her down the
aisle to marry some jackass
she doesn't even love.
Lynette, you have to do this.
Besides, you know, think
of what's at stake now.
What are you talking about?
Well, you know, how can
I put this delicately?
I mean, today your mother has money.
Someday soon she will die.
The day after that,
Tom and Lynette have money.
That's a horrible thing to say.
Well, just saying,
you've always wanted to put
Paige in private school,
and I've always wanted to know what
it's like to sleep on a yacht.
You're lucky you're holding the baby.
Lynette, in all seriousness,
it's your mother's wedding day.
If you don't support her,
you're gonna ruin your relationship.
Lynette!
Yeah?
They're playing my song.
Are you ready to wheel me down?
Lynette! Lynette!
Lynette!
What are you doing?
Okay, here's the thing.
I can't let you do this.
Who asked you?
You can't marry an
obnoxious jerk like that.
Mom, you want me to visit more often?
That is never gonna
happen if you're with him.
And think about the example
you are setting your grandchildren--
marrying a guy for his money.
Now, look, Tom and I
have a little savings--
Lynette,
I know Frank's a bit
of an acquired taste.
But... He needs me.
Nobody needs me anymore.
Your sisters are always busy.
I never see you.
I try to see you
as much as I can, but--
I know.
Your family needs you.
And Frank... needs me.
Why didn't you tell me this?
Why did you let me think
it was all about the money?
I guess it was easier to say that
than to admit how... useless and...
lonely I feel.
Okay.
Hello? We're trying to
have a wedding out here.
Oh, sorry! My daughter doesn't
think you're good enough for me.
She's right.
Now hurry it up.
This church is in one of
those ethnic neighborhoods,
and I'm worried about the car.
Renee, there is someone
we'd like you to meet.
This is our daughter.
Hello.
We just picked her up from the airport,
And we wanted you to be the first
person on the lane to meet her.
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
We know.
I think I'm gonna start
getting her settled in.
Say good-bye to Mrs. Perry.
Bye.
Come on.
She's absolutely precious.
Yeah. We're very lucky.
Listen, can I ask you for a favor?
Lee, you know I don't like
sentences that start that way.
Bob and I have been thinking,
and even though I know we
are gonna be great fathers,
there may be times
that Jenny needs to talk
to a woman about... stuff.
And on those rare occasions,
I was wondering if we
could bring her over here.
Well... Sure.
Great. I will go tell our daughter
that if she needs anything,
she can count on her old auntie Renee.
And if she ever calls me
"old auntie," I will kick her.
Got it. Sorry.
Those are beautiful, Susan.
Thank you, Ethan.
Don't worry. They're not for you.
They're for people who still
possess an ounce of humanity.
Whatever you say, Pollyanna.
But if I see any mylar balloons
with- with dogs wearing stethoscopes,
I'm filing a complaint.
Why are you always so miserable?
It's called anger, Susan.
I'm sure you have it, too,
right underneath that
"Hang in there, Kitty" smile.
Hey, Dick, take it easy.
It's okay, Ethan.
Fine. You're angry.
The rest of us aren't.
So stop dragging us into
your circle of self-pity.
Ugh. Come on.
It's me.
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you.
I gotta go call my mom.
Yeah.
Ready, Susan?
Yes.
Actually, um, if- if it's okay,
I'm gonna... sit over here today.
Sure.
What are you doing?
Leaving a note for the gardener.
If he has any more problems
with those sprinklers,
I want him to know that
we'll be at the cabin.
Oh. Good idea.
Beth, I think we should
bring some extra blankets.
It might get cold.
Would you mind grabbing a couple?
Not at all.
Detectives. Everything okay?
I'm sure your wife told you
a gun was recently discovered
at Bree Van de Kamp's house.
Yes, apparently it was the same caliber
that I was shot with.
Bree seems to think your
wife planted it there,
hoping to implicate some of
her friends in your shooting.
What an imagination she has.
So you've never seen this before?
Mr. Young?
Yes.
You seemed to have
quite a reaction there.
I'm not comfortable
around firearms, that's all.
Well, just to be clear,
you do not believe this
belongs to your wife.
Detectives, I know for a
fact this is not Beth's gun.
Good day.
Should we take two blankets or three?
Forget the blankets. The trip's off.
What? Why?
I got a call.
There's a problem with the cabin.
Oh, shoot.
And I was so looking forward to it.
Trust me, Beth.
I think you dodged a bullet here.
I don't know what
you do to this chicken,
but it's the best thing
that I've ever had. Mmm.
So I, um, stopped by
Bob and Lee's house.
They're so excited about
finally becoming fathers,
which got me to thinking,
I know you had said
that you were okay with not
being able to have a child.
Is that... still the case?
Uh, yeah.
That didn't sound very convincing.
It's kind of a weird question.
Okay, well, let me rephrase it.
If you had the chance to be
a father, would you take it?
Bree, where is this coming from?
I thought we dealt with this.
Well, I just wanna make sure.
I don't want you to see
Bob and Lee with their child
and start to have regrets.
What do you want me to say?
All right, there was a time in
my life when I thought, yeah.
Yeah. I'd love to be a dad,
but then I met you.
I'm just saying...
if you had the choice--
I don't.
This is really good chicken.
So?
I'm sorry.
He doesn't even wanna meet Charlie?
Well, you have to understand
that after six years,
Keith feels that it would
be too difficult for everyone.
Why did I wait so long?
Again, I am so sorry.
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.
Please. Keith and I feel that
we really need to do something.
So please... take it.
Sorry. I had to show the
sitter how to work the TV.
Now where is this chinese pl- aah!
You put her in a car seat?
Oh. Well, she's expensive,
and the way you drive...
Honey, I've been thinking
maybe we should go
see a therapist together.
I don't need a therapist.
I think you do.
Maybe I haven't been fair to you.
but you do really need to
talk to someone about this.
Carlos, I'm not crazy.
Well, then should I change
the reservation to three?
Don't be ridiculous.
She's not gonna sit with us.
She fits right in my bag.
This doesn't look like a
place you'd put a restaurant.
No, it looks like a
place you'd bury a body.
Will you please just put the address
into the navigation system?
For the tenth time, I don't need it.
I know where Oak Park is.
Carlos, I'm starving!
I will not think you're weak
if you use a navigation system!
Fine. I'll use it.
I'd much rather listen to that
annoying voice than that one.
What's the address?
Okay. It's 1-1-9--
Get out of the car!
Oh, god!
Okay, okay, take it easy, man.
Now! Get out.
We're doing it.
Be cool.
Uh, can you hold on?
What do you mean, hold on?!
Get the hell out of the car!
Gaby!
I gotta get my baby!
Oh, crap. Just...
It's a doll!
What are you trying to pull, bitch?!
Oh, god.
Get out before I put a bullet in you!
No!
Gaby!  Get out!
I can't get the buckle!
Gaby, come on!
I can't get the buckle!
I can't get the buckle! Get--uhh!
No! My baby! My baby! My baby!
My baby!
Gaby!
It's not Grace!
Whoa.
What are you doing to your roses?
Pruning them.
Looks like you're killing them.
I know it looks bad,
but sometimes you
have to be ruthless
if you want something
beautiful to keep growing.
The world is filled with
people who do ugly things.
Why do they act this way?
Some lie to keep from
losing what they love.
Some lash out because
they fear the future.
Some put up walls because
they have regrets.
Yes, everyone has a reason for
the ugly things they do...
And once we find out why...
then we can try to stop them.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
You're marrying him for his money?
Lynette had reservations
about her mother's marriage.
You can't marry an obnoxious jerk like that.
Susan began her wait for a kidney donor.
I'm going on the wait list.
That could take years.
Bree found out that Keith had a son
but decided not to tell him...
Keith feels that it would be
too difficult for everyone.
Easing her guilt with a check.
Get out of the car!
Oh, god!
Gaby's obsession with her doll...
I gotta get my baby!
Get out!
Nearly cost her life.
My baby!
Gaby! It's not Grace!
And Paul recognized the gun
that was used to shoot him.
Paul Young had a son.
But he had not seen Zach in years.
He had lost him to a world of fast women...
easy money...
and hard drugs.
Yes, Paul had lost his son...
but he was determined to find him.
And he would do anything...
even if that meant asking for help...
from a man who despised him.
What the hell are you doing here?
I need a favor.
From me?
I know. You hate me, and I hate you.
Now that we're done
with our traditional greeting,
can I tell you what I want?
Yeah, go ahead.
I need to find Zach.
I went to that mansion
his grandfather left him.
It's in foreclosure.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Do you know where he went?
Yeah, I don't know where he is.
And even if I did,
why would I do you any favors?
Zach's the one who shot me.
What?
The police showed me the gun.
It was the same one
Mary Alice used to kill herself.
And Zach kept it?
He's always been a strange boy.
If you really think he tried to kill you,
why didn't you tell the police?
I'd like to keep this in the family.
So again, where is he?
Last I heard, Idaho.
Well...
if you hear from him,
tell him I know what he did...
and I'm very disappointed.
Though he didn't admit it,
Mike knew exactly where Zach was.
But the son Paul Young had lost...
had no interest in being found.
It doesn't matter where we're going.
It doesn't matter
how quickly we try to get there.
It doesn't matter that we never look back.
The past we left behind
will still find a way
to catch up to us.
I'm making grilled salmon.
Why did you get a pizza?
Because you're making grilled salmon.
I wish you wouldn't put that
terrible food in your body.
It's not good for you.
Come on.
You know you want a bite.
Ah. Eat it. Eat it.
Seriously, I have better-tasting
food under my refrigerator.
Hello?
Hi, Bree. It's Amber.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Oh, no, no bother.
Look, I'm outside. I need to talk to you.
No, uh, don't come over.
I'll, um, come to you.
See you soon.
I need to run to Lynette's for a minute.
Do you mind waiting for dinner?
Hurry up. I'm starved.
Hi.
So the bank says your check
is gonna take 5 days to clear.
Is there any way you can
get me a cashier's check?
I really need to pay some bills.
Absolutely.
Um, there's a restaurant
across from the bank.
I can meet you there tomorrow at 2:00.
That'll be great. Thank you again, Bree.
Bree, wait.
I know Keith doesn't wanna meet Charlie.
But he should at least know
what his son looks like.
I'm sure he'll appreciate that.
So according to the donor database,
I will be waiting three to four years.
Where does that put me on the list?
I-I mean, is there a number?
There is no number.
It all boils down to your D.N.A.
And how long you've been waiting.
So, you have your beeper.
Yep.
Four years is a long time.
Susan Bremer?
Yeah?
Monroe Carter. From Fairview high.
I sat behind you in chem lab.
I was yearbook photographer?
Now I sell pharmaceutical supplies.
You know, I friended you on facebook,
like, 12 times.
I guess I didn't get them.
No worries. Tell me,
what's new? How are you?
I need a kidney transplant.
I'm gonna be spending
the next three to four years
on dialysis three times a week,
five hours a day.
Wow. I-I didn't know.
Then again, if you'd friended me...
I'll see you at the reunion...
if I'm still alive.
You like? Frank gave them to me.
They belonged to my first wife.
She's dead.
Isn't that a little... weird?
Hell, no. This necklace
belonged to his second wife,
and she's sitting right over there.
That's weird.
Well, I have to admit,
you two seem very happy together.
Tell her about Saturday.
What about Saturday?
Frank wants you to bring Tom
and the kids back up here.
I wanna take a family portrait.
Family is very important to Frank.
And since my first three families
aren't speaking to me,
I wanna get this one right,
so I can rub it in their miserable faces.
Oh, that's a sweet thought,
but Saturdays are kind of crazy for us.
Penny's got ballet,
Paker's studying for the S.A.T.S...
Well, how about I make it worth your while?
You're bribing me?
Call it gas money
if it'll make you feel any better.
Will $500 do it?
I'm not taking his money.
Frank, i-isn't it time
for your heart medicine?
Look how she takes care of me.
Do what you have to do to make this work.
But I'm not going over a grand.
What are you doing?
I just married the man.
He's in the process of redoing his will,
so we've gotta play ball.
No. I am not gonna bend over backwards
just to please that jerk.
You're the one who married him, not me.
I can't tell Frank no.
But I can tell you no.
So if you want the picture,
you can come to our house.
Fine. I'll talk to him.
And will you stop staring
at this necklace, Phyllis?
You are not getting it back!
So the fashion show ends,
and Yves Saint Laurent...
who doesn't swim, by the way...
rents a yacht for the after-party.
And that's where I met Mick Jagger.
Do you have any wine?
We don't really do wine in therapy.
Ah. Well, you should.
A few glasses, and
you'd have your patients whining
about how daddy didn't love 'em
in half the time.
Did your father not love you?
I was joking.
My dad was great.
He died when I was a kid.
Well, that must have been hard....
growing up without a male presence?
No. She remarried.
Oh, my god.
I forgot to tell you
the best part of the Jagger story.
He read my palm.
And he told me I would be going below deck
to have sex with him.
Not only is he a great singer,
he's an amazing psychic.
Gaby, why don't you like
talking about your childhood?
What's the point? The past is the past.
Well, sometimes what
happens to us in the past
affects who we are today.
Oh, by the way, Jagger... big cuddler.
Gaby, come on.
We're gonna have to go deeper here.
Well, that's the thing about me...
there is no deeper.
Ask any of my friends.
I'm the shallowest person they know.
I'm just skin, a little blood,
and stories about Keith Richards
drinking out of my shoes.
You don't have to be afraid.
Let's talk about your childhood.
I love therapy.
Really?
Yeah. It's like a talk show,
where I'm the guest and
the only topic is me.
So it's helping?
You talked to her about the doll?
Ya-bup-bup-bup-bup!
That is confidential. First rule of therapy.
Actually, first rule of therapy is no wine,
but I'm gonna change that.
I'm so glad this is working.
I've been worried about you.
It's exactly what I needed.
In fact, I'm gonna be
going three times a week...
Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
Wow, that's a lot.
Well, it was your idea.
Oh, by the way, uh,
you're gonna have to take over
my carpools on Mondays.
That's okay, right?
Sure. I guess I could
move some things around.
Oh! And no golf on Thursdays,
because you'll have
to take Juanita to ballet.
Gaby, I do business on the links.
Do you want me to get better or not?
Okay.
Okay. I will cancel golf.
Oh, and on Friday,
I have a gynecologist appointment.
Gaby!
That I need you to cancel.
Wouldn't that be great, though?
Hi.
Hi.
I see you brought Charlie.
Well, you know, I don't
have anyone to watch him.
I have your cashier's check.
Thank you again, Bree.
Honey, let's go.
No. I haven't finished my pizza.
Let's go.
No!
Listen, Bree, do you mind
keeping an eye on him?
The bank is right across the way.
I'll only be ten minutes.
I don't know. I-I...
Just order some pizza. It'll be on me.
So, Charlie...
I'm gonna play games.
Right.
Much better than conversation.
Oh. Mr. Lynwood.
Susan.
My beeper went off. Does that mean...
Yes, we found you a donor.
Oh, but how? You said it
would probably take years.
The rules change if someone
wants to donate a kidney
to a specific individual.
Wait. Uh... this is someone I know?
Apparently.
He's in my office right
now signing the paperwork.
It's a he?
I'm getting a man kidney?
Not that I'm complaining.
Oh, my god.
Hey, Susan.
Monroe. You're my donor?
Yeah. Turns out I'm a match.
What are the odds?
I don't know what to say.
Well, I'm giving you a vital organ.
How about "Thank you"?
Why would you do this?
We haven't seen each other in years, and...
I barely remembered you.
I remembered you.
You were really wonderful
to me in high school.
And you're in trouble,
and I wanna help.
Well... thank you.
So what's a guy gotta do to get a hug?
Give you a lung?
Oh, come here, you!
Oh, please know you've made me very happy.
I'm so glad.
Busted.
I'm on my way to Mrs. Goodman's
place to finish that job,
and what do I see?
Your car, parked in front of a pizza joint.
Yeah, about that...
Admit it. You're hooked.
What are you, a deep-dish girl? Thin crust?
Yep. You got me. I am a closet pizza lover.
Mystery solved. You can go to your job now.
I need more quarters.
Who's this? What do you got,
some secret boyfriend?
This is, um, Charlie.
I'm, uh, watching, uh,
him for a friend of mine.
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I don't have any more change.
Now, could you excuse us?
You got quarters?
I got some.
Come on.
What about Mrs. Goodman?
She's lived without
a screen door for 30 years.
She can wait another half hour.
All right. Let's see what you got.
I'm gonna show you something.
This is a secret, all right?
But this is just between you and me. Hand...
In the cookie jar. Bang. Let's see it.
Hey! High five.
That was a good one.
Let's see it again. One more.
Uh-huh. Step-back jumper fadeaway.
Nice one.
Are you kiddin' me? One more,
I'm calling the NBA.
That was awesome.
Did you see that? Three in a row.
I certainly did. It was wonderful.
Charlie, I gotta take off. Nice meeting you.
See you later.
Bye!
Bye. Remember me when you're on the Lakers.
They're here!
Whoa. Frank drives a Bentley.
Of course he does.
Why are we taking this stupid picture?
I mean, we barely even know the guy.
We're doing it for your grandma.
And the lovely man she just married.
Hello! Welcome!
Hello, everybody!
Hey, grandma.
So, this really is where they live.
I thought you were kiddin'.
How was the drive over, Frank?
It took forever.
We got behind this Asian woman driver...
slow as soy sauce going uphill in winter.
Okay. Small talk's over.
Let's take the picture.
We were all thinking we'd sit over here.
No, I don't wanna see your crappy
kitchen in the background there.
Let's move this sofa over there.
I want it to be real homey.
Cagney and Lacey,
grab this end of the couch.
What are you doing?
You can't just walk into people's houses
and move furniture around.
When it looks like this, you can.
Uh... no, no, no. Put it back.
It's bad enough you make me
drive all the way out here
to east podunk. Well, bull!
I want my picture, my way!
Hey!
Whatever you say.
Frank, that's too heavy. You're all red.
Well, that's 'cause the girls
here were not much help.
Okay, everyone.
Come and take your place around...
Grandpa Frank.
Okay.
Here we go.
Everybody smile and say "Bentley."
Bentley.
Okay. Nobody move.
I wanna check that it's good.
Ooh. Hang on.
We have to do it again.
Frank, your eyes are closed.
Frank?
Frank?
Oh, no.
What's wrong?
He's dead.
Of course he is.
There's no pulse.
No pulse. He's definitely dead.
Is his ghost gonna be trapped in our house?
Is he gonna haunt us?
No, honey. Of course not.
Gross. A dead guy's on our couch.
And I'm having friends over.
How long till he starts to smell?
Kids, go upstairs.
There's nothing to see here.
Whoa. What are you talking about?
There's a dead body.
That's totally something to see.
Okay, kids. Come on. Let's go. Upstairs.
Come on.
Mom, I'm so sorry.
I can't believe he's gone. Just like that.
I know. I know.
What are you doing?
Uh, I'm calling the police
so they can get a coroner over here.
Uh, hang on. Y-you can't call them yet.
Why not?
That new will I told you about...
the one leaving everything to me?
It doesn't go into effect until tomorrow.
Oh, no.
No, no.
You want me to keep him here?
Like that? All night?
If we call the coroner now,
I get nothing.
If we call in the morning... millions.
I didn't want Frank in
my house when he was alive.
Now you want me to hang out with his corpse?
Well, then throw a sheet over him
and spray a little air freshener.
You won't even notice.
Frank wanted me to have that money.
No! I-it's too weird!
Y-you wouldn't have to
take care of me anymore.
In fact, I could even take care of you.
College tuition? Braces?
It would make me feel so good
to be able to help you for a change.
It's been a long time, son.
Yeah, I guess.
How's it going?
I couldn't be better.
What, uh, can I do for ya? Wait, wait, wait.
Let me guess. You want money.
I nailed it, didn't I? Uh, but you can see,
a lot of other people...
they... they got here first.
Well, sorry to hear that.
Who cares? It's time to downsize,
minimize my carbon footprint.
You feeling okay, buddy?
I feel great.
Sounds like you're the one having problems.
Well, Susan and I are going
through a rough time,
like a lot of people.
So how screwed are you?
We had to rent out our house...
to your father, in fact.
My father's in prison.
He's out.
You didn't know?
No.
You sure you're okay?
I just can't believe
that bastard gets to walk free
after everything that he did!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
It's-it's okay. Just...
Could you leave?
I-I-I-I need to be alone. Just...
Tom...
You never sneak up behind someone
when they're staring at a dead person!
I'm sorry. It's just... your scream...
it was like all the testosterone
left your body at once.
This whole thing creeps me out.
It's just...
a body.
How do you become this guy?
9 kids, 14 grandchildren,
and you never talk to any of them.
That's the tricky thing about money.
Changes people.
Changes relationships.
It sure does.
And after you're dead, what's it all mean?
Not funny.
Hello.
Hi. This is Maria.
I'm just calling to confirm
Gabrielle Solis for her 1:00 appointment.
Yep. She's on her way.
Terrific. You wouldn't happen to know
what kind of treatment
she wants today, do you?
Uh, I don't know.
Whatever you've been doing
seems to be working.
Well, on Monday she got the seaweed wrap,
Wednesday the hot stone massage.
We just want to make sure
she takes full advantage
of our entire spa menu.
Oh, she is taking full advantage, all right.
Oh, good, Sandro. There you are.
I think we should start
on my shoulders today.
Mm. That's good.
Maybe a little lighter on the pressure.
No, no. Lighter.
Okay, maybe let's not do the shoulders.
Okay. How about the glutes?
Carlos? What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in therapy.
This is therapy! Didn't you see the sign?
"Massage therapy," "Aromatherapy."
I talked to Dr. Wyner. She said that
you haven't been back since
the first session. Why not?
Well... I just don't think I really need it.
I mean, this is really helping.
No. This is ignoring the problem.
You know, the way you say "Problem,"
you make it seem
a whole lot worse than it actually is.
Gaby, you almost got us killed
pulling a doll out of the car.
Fine. If it'll get you off my ass,
I'll make an appointment for next week.
Now get your clothes on. We're leaving.
God, now I'm so tense.
I'll give you 100 bucks
if you work on my shoulders
for ten minutes. Aah!
That's for free. Let's go.
He-he came downstairs just
after midnight to watch some tv,
and we didn't find him until this morning.
Well, in that case,
I'll just put down time
of death around 3:00 A.M.
Would you like us
to bring the body directly
to the funeral home?
Yes, thank you.
Again, ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.
Oh, my god. I'm rich!
Again, ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.
Oh, I know.
I spent some of the best weeks
of my life with Frank.
But he's gone,
there's nothing we can do about it,
and I am a millionaire.
Good. You can buy me a new couch.
I'll buy you whatever you want.
Oh, I was kidding.
Well, I wasn't. What do you need? Anyone.
I need a laptop for school.
Done.
Can I have a motorcycle?
For school?
Kids, knock it off.
Frank's body's not even in the van yet.
Actually, it is.
I don't care.
We're not talking about money right now.
A man died... not a bank account... a man.
Let's show a little respect.
We should probably figure out
what to do about that Bentley.
Zach?
Anybody here?
Whoa, Zach. Zach, it's me!
Sorry. It's, uh...
it's a rough neighborhood.
You know how it is.
So... two visits in one year.
What's up?
Hey, would you mind, uh,
sitting down? We need to talk.
Do we?
Sure... just... a minute.
Who you looking for, Zach? Your father?
Paul came to see me.
He thinks you shot him. That true?
Okay. I shot him.
He ruined my life,
but he gets to start his over.
It didn't seem right.
Oh, god.
It was easy. I practiced it
in my head over and over again,
and then... bam! Showtime.
But then I got all paranoid
and I dumped the stupid gun at Bree's.
I mean, I don't... I don't
know what I was thinking with that one.
I wasn't thinking.
Yeah. That's the problem with being high.
You do things without thinking.
What? I'm not using drugs.
Zach. I've been there.
You need help.
Now we got to get you into rehab.
You want to send me to rehab?
So what, so my father can come
and find me and take me to prison?
No way.
I just want to get you some help.
It's too late for you
to pretend to be my father.
You're right. But I still care.
Then why did you let me go
in the first place?
You're the one who let me
get raised by that monster.
No, that's not how things happened.
I don't care. I don't care.
Let me help you...
Just get out my house, all right?
Just get out of my house!
It's really nice of you to have me over.
Are you kidding?
I am gonna be spending the rest
of my life thinking of ways to
thank you. But as a start...
Oh. Really?
Oh, come on. All right, let's...
That is so sweet.
A crystal heart.
I looked for a crystal kidney...
surprisingly hard to find.
You know, in high school
I always dreamt you'd give me your heart.
You know, speaking of high school,
I, uh, have a present for you, too.
In addition to the one that's
being ripped out of your body?
I'm sorry. That...
that was a little too vivid.
No, that's all right.
Here, uh... here you go.
Oh... what is this?
It's just some memorabilia
that I'd thought you'd enjoy.
Some photos I took that
I didn't make the cut for the yearbook.
Oh, my god.
There I am on the field hockey team...
and in "Pippin."
These are great.
Who else do you have in here?
Oh, there's me on the debate club...
and me at the spring formal...
me in a bathing suit...
taken through a fence.
Not easy to get.
Those bushes around
your yard were really thick.
Is this one of my old English papers?
Yeah. You threw it away,
and I fished it out of the garbage.
That's also where I found this. Uh....
Here.
My retainer?
I would have returned it,
but I was too scared to talk to you.
Isn't it funny how we're talking now?
Yeah, really funny.
And now...
we're gonna be bonded...
you know... forever.
You know, if you told me back
in high school that one day
my kidney would be cleansing
Susan Bremer's blood,
I would have been the happiest guy on earth.
Well, I'm glad I could make
that happen for you.
Oh, my.
Here
Why don't you go see
what's shaking at the malt shop?
Wow. Thanks, grandma.
Hey. What's all this?
A little thank you
for all the help you've been
the last few days. Open it, open it.
Wow, it's beautiful.
Mm-hmm. 2200 bucks. Didn't bat an eye.
That's a lot of money.
Oh, there's more where that came from.
Hey, why don't you and the whole fam-damily
come to my house for dinner Sunday night?
I thought you were coming here Sunday night.
I was gonna send one of
the kids to pick you up.
Nah. I think it's better you come to me.
Oh, but Sunday's a school night,
and Tom's got
an early meeting Monday morning.
How about Saturday?
Nah. Sunday.
Oh, heads up...
Dinners at the center are fancy.
You'll have to squeeze
those boys of yours into
some jackets and ties.
But, mom... mom... mom!
Are you not listening?
It's not gonna work for us.
I would think you would want
to make it work, Lynette...
given everything I'm gonna
be doing for the family.
Are you blackmailing me?
No! I'm inviting you to dinner.
If you can't make it,
I can ask one of your sisters.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, cover your man. Come on.
Hey, babe. Game's almost over.
Are you kidding me?
You okay?
I'm sorry. I should have
given this to you before.
Why are you giving me a picture
of the kid from the pizza place?
He's your son.
I still can't get over this.
You run into some random
classmate from high school,
and he's gonna end up saving your life?
Here's the part I can't get over.
You never put out for this guy?
No. No, I barely remember him.
Monroe is just doing
this incredibly selfless act
of charity. It's inspiring.
What's this?
Uh... n-nothing. Just put that away.
It's got your name on the cover in glitter.
No, it's just a gift from Monroe.
Can I please have that?
Oh, my god.
Yeah. You used to be cute. What happened?
No, there's, like,
a million pictures of you in here.
I guess he had a little crush on me.
Crush? No, Susan. This Monroe
guy's obsessed with you.
This is a shrine.
It is not.
It is. I know.
I've made them. That's why I'm not allowed
to mail things to Ryan Seacrest anymore.
It's creepy. It's like the part of the movie
when they go to the guy's
basement and find the candles
in front of the picture of
the woman he's gonna kill.
You know... those guys
are often misunderstood.
And you're gonna take
a kidney from this man?
Okay, I admit,
I-I'm a little concerned, and,
yes, he may be 5% stalker.
Is this a lock of your hair?
10% stalker.
But if I don't take his kidney,
I could wait another six years.
Why shouldn't I do it?
Because you'll be forever connected to him.
You'll never get rid of him.
And I have a feeling
That's not the only organ
he wants to... share with you.
Carlos, can you feel my forehead?
No.
I think I have a fever.
You're fine.
You didn't even feel!
'Cause I don't need to. Liar.
No, I'm really sick. Let's reschedule.
I shouldn't see the therapist today.
We're going in.
What if I need to throw up?
It's a therapist's office.
You're supposed to get it all out.
Carlos...
You are going to therapy,
and that's all there is to it.
Fine. Can I at least go
to the bathroom first?
You know I have a bladder
the size of a dime.
How many years have we been married?
Too many, if you ask me!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm going home.
No. Gaby, you are sick. You need help.
Look, you want me take pills,
I will take them.
You want me to see a hypnotist?
Bring him to the house.
Hell, I'll even let you hire
a priest to do an exorcism.
But what I am not going to do
is talk to that woman in there.
Why not?
Because she wants to
talk about my childhood!
Can I say one thing?
You did find a way to talk
about it before... with me.
Just that once. We had gotten married.
I thought you had a right to know.
And you said that you never
wanted to talk about it again,
and I have respected that.
But over the years,
I have seen what it costs you.
The nights I hear you
crying in the bathroom...
Sad look on your face when
people ask about your past...
You think that you've left it behind,
but you haven't, Gaby.
You carry that burden around with you.
I just want you to consider the idea that
this therapist might be able
to help you let all that go.
Can you come with me?
So when I lost Grace,
it tapped into this need
I have to protect children.
Where do you think this need came from?
'Cause no one protected me.
When I was a child,
my stepfather molested me.
Get in.
Why would I do that?
I know where Zach is.
Are we driving to Idaho?
Look, the reason I didn't
tell you where he was before
is I didn't know what
you wanted to do to him.
But whatever it is,
it can't be worse than
what he's doing to himself.
And why should I care about
that after he tried to kill me?
He's your son.
He's my son.
He needs our help.
Hey, neighbor.
Monroe. Uh...
What do you mean, "neighbor"?
Well, uh, your landlady's
showing me an apartment.
I figured now that
we're back in each other's lives,
it would be better if I lived close.
Yeah, uh...
Here's the thing about that.
There's close...
and then there's Glenn Close.
This feels a little...
stalky.
Stalky?
I-I'm giving you a kidney.
Monroe, come with me.
The other day, when you were over here,
I did not give you the full story.
This is Mike.
He is my husband.
And this is our son M.J.
Okay. Why are you showing me this?
Because I want you to see that
there isn't room for anyone
else in that picture.
Don't get me wrong.
I am so grateful that
you want to give me a kidney.
But once the operation is over,
that has to be it.
Why?
Because...
you want to be more than friends,
and I'm married.
The tricky part is that...
I still need a kidney...
'cause I want to stay healthy for...
the two special guys in that picture.
So if you...
still want to give me one...
no strings attached,
I will be honored to take it...
and you will have my eternal gratitude.
Yeah, but that's all I'll have.
What do you say?
I can't.
I, uh...
I thought if I did this, then...
you would finally...
I-I know.
I know.
I-I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
I'll be fine.
All right. I guess...
I'll-I'll see you around.
Actually, I guess I won't.
We may think we've left the past behind,
but it has a way...
of catching up to us.
Though we want to run away,
we are forced to confront our past...
and the secrets that it buried...
must come into the light.
And then, if we are strong,
we are able to move on.
Yes, we all need to leave the past behind
and move on toward the future.
And if we're lucky,
we will have help getting there.

Do we have any eggs?
Yes. We have eggs.
Where do we keep them?
In the refrigerator.
Cool. Thanks.
How do you make an omelet?
You don't have to come down.
Just, uh, tell us
where the stuff is.
No, it's just easier
if I do it myself.
Two omelets, coming up.
Actually, um, could you make mine

Okay. Got it. Look...
This isn't a frat house.
This is our family home,

There are all sorts
of ways to leave.
Some people shake hands...
others offer a gentle wave.
A few like to give big hugs.
Then there are those
who refuse to leave
until someone else says...
"get out."
Morning, boys.
Why are you handing me
classified ads?
You have seven days
to find another place to live.
Whoa, whoa.
You're kicking us out?
You said I could stay here
until I finished college.
Yeah, we're starting to think
that's not gonna happen.
Guys, please don't do this.
We like it here.  Of course you do.
You think doing laundry
is throwing dirty clothes
in the hamper and getting
clean ones out of the drawer.
That's how dad does it.
O... okay, let's stay on topic.
Guys,you need to grow up,
learn to be independent,
And that's gonna start
with you getting your own place.
And how are we gonna pay for it?
If you turn that paper over,
you'll find a whole section
Of people willing to exchange money
for something called work!
We have to get jobs?
This is crazy.
You guys are acting
like we stabbed you last night.
Oh, obviously you didn't do that.
You don't know
where the knives are.
Now start making some calls.
You really think
that they're ready?
No. And that's why
we have to do this.
Those boys are drifting
through life, tom.
If we don't do something soon,
we'll have twin 50-year-olds
living in the basement,
screaming upstairs for juice.
You're right.
Unless we push 'em out of the nest,
They'll never learn to fly.
Mm-hmm.
Do you have to dial a "1"
before the area code?
And the first chick
lands with a thud.
Yes. I've been on hold for,
like, 4 miles.
I just got a notice
that my insurance
is only covering partial payment
of my dialysis.
No, that can't be right.
I can't afford that, and I need
treatments three times a week.
Ooh! Oh! Aah! Damn it!
Oh, uh, not you.
I just ruined my shirt
And saved a chipmunk's life
in the same move.
This is not a good day.
Oh, crap!
Morning, ma'am.
Do you know why I pulled you over?
To commend me for saving
that chipmunk's life?
No. You didn't come to a complete stop
at that stop sign at Ferndale.
License and registration, please?
I'm sorry. I guess I was
just really distracted.
I was trying to talk
to the insurance company,
And then the coffee spilled,
and now...
I'm gonna be late
for my dialysis appointment,
which means that
all the good chairs will be taken
and I will end up
in the chair by the bathroom,
and I will spend the next six hours
listening to people flush.
Dialysis?
Man, that must be rough.
Yeah, and it explains why I look a lot
more bloated than I do on my license.
Look, I don't want you
to be late for your appointment.
I'll let you off with a warning.
Oh. Really?
Good luck, ma'am.
Thank you.
And thank you, dialysis.
I don't wanna go
on this stupid trip.
It's only 24 hours.
Trust me. 24 hours in my hometown
feels like 2 years.
Those people are...
are small-minded,
They're bigoted, and their teeth...
it's the land orthodontia forgot.
Well, it produced you,
so it can't be all bad.
Ugh! Please. You know what
that town is famous for?
The second-longest-burning
tire fire in america.
Gaby, I think we both know
why you don't wanna go.
And it's not about the town.
Okay, you're right.
But I don't care
what my therapist says.
I don't wanna fly to Texas
to stand on some dead guy's grave
and read him a letter.
That dead guy
was your stepfather,
and he abused you.
When Dr. Wyner told you
to write down how you felt,
that helped, didn't it?
I guess. Well, then I really think
you should listen to her
when she says that reading it
at his grave will help.
Confronting him
will give you closure.
He's dead. Can't I just confront him
from the comfort of my own home,
with a glass of wine
and a ouija board?
If you absolutely
don't want to do this,
you don't have to.
But I really wish you would.
Fine. 24 hours, one graveside rant,
and then we come home.
Why are you bringing evening wear?
It's the anniversary
of the tire fire.
There's gonna be a party.
We're almost there, Zach.
These people are gonna
be able to help you.
I don't need to go to rehab.
Tell that to the puke
on my shoes.
Thank god your mother never
saw you like this.  Easy, Paul.
You can't make me go.
Zach, face it. You're going.
Okay. I will.
I promise. Tomorrow.
Just let me out now.
Let me out. Let go of me!
I'm trying to help you.
You? You?
You did this to me.
You're the reason I'm like this.
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
Paul, ignore him. He's sick.
I'm not sick!
He's sick! I'm fine!
You're fine?!
Ow.
You shot me!
You shot your own father!
Does that sound fine to you?!
Paul!
Paul, let him go.
You're going to rehab.
You're gonna take these drugs
and flush 'em out of you,
And then we're gonna talk,
or I swear
I will drive your sorry ass
to prison myself!
So you can either dry out in rehab
or take your chances in jail.
I'm good either way!
Let's go.
Now with just the top...
tip of your fingers,
right there on the seam.
Right... yeah. There.
Then, when you throw the ball,
you whip your hand down, right?
Gets the...
gets it spinning faster.
Let's give it a shot.
Really whip those fingers.
Take it easy!
Charlie, it's time to go.
No, mom, please.
Five more minutes!
Sorry, sweetie, we have to get back
to the hotel and start packing.
Hey, you heard your mom.
I'll see you in the morning, okay?
I just need to ice down this hand.
I can't believe they're flying
back to Florida tomorrow.
I know. I wish you'd had a chance
to spend more time with him.
Yeah, I wish that, too.
Unfortunately, we lost a week
while you decided
whether or not to tell me
they were here.
Yes. And again, I am so sorry.
That is my son.
How could you keep him from me?
What were you thinking?
I'm not proud of what I did,
but I didn't want to lose you.
Don't make it sound romantic.
What you did was
unbelievably selfish.
I know.
If this relationship is gonna
have any future at all,
we have to at least
be honest with each other.
I feel terrible.
Just please don't be angry.
I am angry.
But mostly at this...
at this crappy situation.
I... you and me,
I'm sure that we'll get past this.
Mom, this is taking forever.
"Tom and Jerry"
is on in ten minutes.
I know, honey.
You promised we'd be home.
M.J., what do you want me to do?
I... I can't make these people disappear.
You promised.
Um, I forgot foil.
Will you go get me a roll?
Excuse me.
Uh, I know you're
all probably in a hurry,
but would you mind
if I went in front of you?
You see, I have
my dialysis appointment,
and if I'm late,
I start to get a little weak.
You poor thing.
Bless you.
My aunt is on dialysis.
Well, my defective little kidney
and I thank you both.
All right! We're gonna get
to see "Tom and Jerry"!
Uh, Tom is my doctor.
Jerry is his nurse.
Then when I'm late, boy,
they really go at each other.
So this is it.
Yep. I was wrong.
It can be worse than I remembered.
It's not that bad.
Really? Because when
we asked the cabbie to turn left
at the burned-out car, he said,
"you're gonna have
to be a little more specific."
Uh-oh. Get out a couple singles.
You look lost.
I take it you folks
aren't from around here.
Yes and no. Mostly no.
Wait a minute. You're not
Gabrielle Marquez, are you?
Yes. Do I know you?
No, but I know you.
From all those magazines.
You're a supermodel!
Welcome back.
Uh...
well, thank you.
Looks like the old place
hasn't changed a bit.
Sound like someone hasn't seen
the new stoplight yet.
Ahh. So, what brings you
back to town?
We should check in to the hotel.
Nice meeting you, lady.
Hotel? I thought we were going
to the cemetery first.
Well, it's been a long trip, Carlos.
I just wanna lie down
for a few minutes.
So was the flight on time?
Yeah. The one time I'm begging
for an 8-hour delay,
and they leave the gate
three minutes early.
Oh, Keith.
Three days ago, I didn't even
know that this kid existed,
And now I don't know
how I'm gonna live without him.
He's a wonderful little boy.
Yeah. Yeah, he is.
My whole childhood,
my dad was in the army.
He'd be gone for six,
seven months at a clip,
And then back for two weeks
and gone again.
I always swore that I would
never do that to my kid.
And guess what? Here I am.
Keith, you are not your father.
I actually said to Charlie,
"I'll see you before you know it."
That's exactly what my old man
used to say to me.
And you know what
it really meant?
"I have no idea
when I'll see you."
I wish there was
something I could do.
There's nothing anybody can do.
It is what it is.
Well, I think that's everything.
We're really proud of you guys.
Found your own apartment.
Did it all on your own.
You really stepped up.
When can we see the new place?
Well, give us a few days.
Let us get it all fixed up.
We should get going.
Oh! Hold on, hold on.
This is a big moment.
Our boys have grown up.
I... uh...
Let me just get one shot.
Aw. I will treasure
this memory always.
I love you. Drive safe. Oh!
Okay. Call us when you get there.
Yep. Bye. Bye.
I know this is good for them,
but I have to tell you,
I miss them already. Oh!
What the hell?
Roy, come on out.
Our new tenants are here.
What are you doing?
Deleting a memory.
Yes. Well, I really want to.
I just don't see how I can
with my dialysis schedule.
Yes, dialysis.
Really?
Well, thank you so much.
Jury duty... excused.
And that was over the phone.
I mean, they didn't even
get to see my sad head tilt
with the trembling lower lip.
Susan... using your disease
to manipulate and deceive people?
I've never felt closer to you.
Oh, you know what?
I deserve it.
I mean, it's the only perk
to come out of this whole thing.
This stupid disease
has totally changed my life.
I spend six hours a day,
three times a week
hooked up to a machine.
So, you know, if I get to cut in a few lines,
and get out of a ticket,
I'm doing it.
Ooh. Do you really wanna
use your powers for evil?
I'm listening.
Let's go to lunch at Girard's.
I've been dying
to try that place out,
but they don't take reservations.
And you have to wait
hours for a table.
Well, not with me, you don't.
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way, but...
bad kidney Susan...
Way more fun
than 2-kidney Susan.
You sure you wanna eat here?
I think I just saw
two cockroaches throwing up.
It's fine. Everyone in my family
used to come here.
Didn't they all die young
of heart disease?
Honey, you've seen this town.
Would you really
wanna grow old here?
Oh, my god.
It's Gabrielle Marquez.
Finally! We were wondering
if you were ever gonna
make it back home again.
I am such a huge fan.
I even have one of your swimsuit
covers on my bathroom wall.
It's my thin-spiration.
Uh, could you have your,
uh, chauffeur over here
Take a picture of us?
Would you mind?
Oh... be happy to, sir.
Uh, okay.
Can I get your autograph?
My autograph?
You know, we even have
a nacho platter named after you.
It would be my honor
to bring you one.
Sounds great, only make it
a scoop of cottage cheese
with sliced tomatoes.
Ms. Marquez? Principal Gomez.
I run the school
you used to attend.
Welcome back to Las Colinas.
You have no idea
how proud we are of you.
Seriously?  Yes, our young people
don't have any role models.
No one else from here
has ever been famous...
I mean, for anything besides
getting stuck down a well.
Ahh. I can't believe
all you people remembered me.
I had no idea.  You know,
it would do so much for school morale
if you would come by tomorrow
and speak to the girls.
Actually, we're kind of busy.
I could call the press.
But we're never too busy
to help girls in need.
How's noon?
Gaby, our flight leaves at 10:00.
Flights can be changed.
I'm sorry. My chauffeur
has no sense of community.
Now... who else wants
to take a picture with me?
How did it go with Zach?
Did you get him checked in?
It's done.
Oh, you must be so relieved.
I know I am.
After the riot,
when you talked about
us getting away...
I felt so hopeful.
But then, I... it seemed like you...
I don't know...
pulled away?
You've been so cold and distant.
Not that I blame you.
I can't imagine what
you've been through.
No. You can't.
But now we can put it behind us,
get back to how we were.
Start to build
our life together.
I miss you. I miss...
being close to you.
What is that?
Your gun.
I borrowed it.
But why did you feel
you needed a gun?
For protection.
My son tried to kill me.
Fool me once.
What about you, Beth?
Wh... what do you mean?
I was just wondering why my bride
needed to bring a gun into our home.
You have to admit,
it's not very romantic.
If the gun bothers you...
we can get rid of it.
I don't understand.
Are you upset with me?
I... is that why
you've been acting this way?
Paul, please talk to me.
I have a lot on my mind.
Of course you do.
This whole thing
has been a nightmare.
But we've come through it.
And with Zach getting help...
maybe things will be good now.
Really?
When someone
so close betrays you,
can things ever be good again?
I thought of something
you could do for me.
Again? But we just...
No, not that.
Oh.
Remember yesterday,
when you said you wished
There was something
you could do
About the whole
Charlie situation?
Well, there is.
Let's move to Florida.
What?
I've been thinking
about this for hours.
With my job I can work anywhere.
You sold your business,
your kids are grown.
What's keeping you here?
Uh, my friends...
I will build a guesthouse,
and they can stay all winter.
Ah, well, it would be
an adventure.
Totally.
Come on. We'll pick oranges
and swim with dolphins
And do all the other stuff
you do in Florida.
What do you say?
I think I can't.
Why?
Because this is my home.
I know.
There's just...
there's no other way for me
to be close to Charlie.
Unless...
never mind.
Unless what?
Unless...
I move there without you,
and I can't do that,
because long-distance
relationships don't ever work,
and I don't want to jeopardize
what you and I have.
Well, maybe we should
talk about that.
No, no, forget it.
Forget the whole thing.
All right, I...
I just keep waiting
for an answer to appear,
and there just isn't one.
Let's go back to sleep.
Shh, shh, shh!
Local newspaper.
So since I've left Las Colinas,
I've been everywhere...
Paris, Rome, New York...
But the place
I feel most at home?
Probably New York.
No, thank you.
They're doing
a cover story on me...
"Solis... so lovely."
Isn't that great?
Uh, it is. It's just that
I think you're starting to lose track
of why we came here.
You still have some serious work to do.
When are we going to that cemetery?
I don't think I need to.
Then how are you
planning to get closure?
It's already happening.
This trip has been amazing.
Look, you have to understand,
when I lived in this town before,
I felt like nothing.
So to come back and get
all this love from all these people...
that's healing for me.
I feel so much better.
And I'm happy for you, Gaby.
I just don't know if it's enough.
It's enough for me, Carlos.
Do you mind?
That's the radio station.
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
Absolutely. I'm all set.
"Hi. This is Gabrielle Marquez Solis,
And when I'm in Las Colinas,
I get my farm report from KYAP."
This is not leaving the nest.
This is more like nest-adjacent.
I know, but Mrs. McCluskey
is a tough old broad.
If anyone can whip them
into shape, she can.
Oh. I'll get it.
Hello.
How do make a Denver omelet?
Why do you want to know?
Because I made some
for the boys,
And they didn't like them.
They said yours are better.
You know what?
I'll be right over.
And I'm like, "you shut up,"
And he's like, "No, you shut up."
So tell me, who shut up?
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, mom.
Hi, Preston's mom.
Hi.
So what brings you here?
Your mom came by to share
a few recipes with me.
Oh, good idea.
We don't want a repeat
of last night's pork fiasco.
Dryer's done.
I'll leave your clothes at the foot
of your beds.  Whoa, whoa.
What? Please don't tell me
you're doing their laundry.
Oh, it's no bother.
We love having the boys here,
don't we, Roy?
Yeah. Aside from them
yelling out the answers
To "Wheel of fortune,"
it's been a real treat.
But seriously, that's got to stop.
The whole point of this
was to get them to grow up
and take care of themselves.
They just moved
from my boob to yours.
Nice breakfast talk, Lynette.
They need to learn
to be responsible.
This isn't good for them.
They're fine.
Your sons are nice,
upstanding young men.
Sure, for one night.
Give them time.
Look, if they pull
any shenanigans,
I'll give 'em the boot,
but so far, they've been
the perfect tenants.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
They had girls spend the night.
You're okay with those two
walking around your house?
Look, I don't care
what gets Roy's fire going
as long as I'm the one
who puts it out.
Now, girls, if it were up to me,
I'd say avoid math and science.
They cause serious frown lines.
Gaby, please tell
the nice girls you're joking.
No. Young girls today
need to know the dangers
of long division.
Excuse me, girls.
Gaby, I have someone
who I'm sure you'll want
to say hello to.
Hello, Gabrielle.
You must remember Sister Marta.
She's been with us almost 30 years.
A real treasure.
Of course.
Well, I'll let you two catch up.
So, Gabrielle,
What brings you back?
I have some...
personal business.
Well, it looks like you're...
enjoying yourself.
I'm not surprised.
You always did love
being the center of attention.
You didn't seem
too thrilled to see her.
Who is she?
Gaby?
I'll be right back.
We need to talk.
All right.
Do you remember a discussion
we had here 20 years ago?
I've had a lot of students
over the years, gabrielle.
I can't remember everything.
I think you remember
this conversation.
I told you what was
happening with my stepfather.
Yes.
You had a big imagination,
most likely from all of those
Trashy books and magazines
you used to sneak into class.
Oh, my god.
You still don't believe me.
I came to you with a secret,
a horrible secret.
I couldn't tell my mother
or anyone in my family.
But I thought I could trust you,
because you were
my teacher and a nun.
So I told you.
Do you remember
what you said to me?
I'm not going to stand here
and listen to this.
Yes, you are.
You told me I was a liar
and that I should be
ashamed of myself,
and I have been
ashamed ever since!
Is that why you came back here...
to blame me?
No. I came back here because
my therapist had a crazy idea.
She thought it would help
if I stood on the grave
of the man who abused me
and told him how I felt.
But you know what?
I think I need to tell you.
I did not deserve
what happened to me.
I was a child.
But you...
you were a grown-up,
and you did nothing.
You should be
ashamed of yourself.
Everything okay?
Yes.
We can go home now.
Hi. I brought you a little
housewarming present.
Is it ticking?
Look, I know I have been
hard on you guys,
but you landed on your feet,
and this is just my way
of saying, "have a blast."
You deserve it.
You're kidding.
Wow, a whole keg?
We can't drink that by ourselves.
Well, maybe you should
have a party.
Yeah. It's a chance to show
everyone your new digs.
Everyone.
I can wait all day.
Look, I already told you
I'm not going to the police.
I just want to know.
Why did you shoot me?
Because I wanted you to die.
Too vague?
Okay. I'm gonna...
try to be more specific.
All my life, I hated you.
That is not true.
It is true. That hate
was always a part of me,
but it... it started
getting bigger, and then...
one day, I... I realized it was
the only thing that I was.
That was the drugs
making you think that way.
I know that you want
to believe that. No.
That was you.
You did this to me.
You do this to everyone.
You're evil.
You have no idea what I am...
how I feel, what
I've been through.
When your mother,
that horrible day...
No, no, no. You don't get to use
that to explain who you are.
You are the reason
mom killed herself.
Don't say that!
It isn't true.
Wow. Dad, that
really hurt, didn't it?
Maybe trying
to kill you was stupid,
'cause you being alive, knowing
the truth... that's way better.
Your mother loved me.
No one could ever love you.
Ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow.
I'm returning these.
They're defective.
I saw what happened
to the front of your house.
Boys, how could you?
Oh, that's nothing.
You should see the inside.
They broke three
of my collectible shot glasses.
I was this close
to having one from every state.
You think I want
to go back to wyoming?
What do you have to say
to Mrs. McCluskey?
Can we get our
security deposit back?
Ugh. Monsters.
So what's for breakfast?
Nothing.
Fine. I'm going upstairs to crash.
No.
No. Once you are done cleaning up
over at Mrs. McCluskey's,
you guys are hitting
the rental ads again.
What? We just got evicted,
and we're really hung over.
This is not a good time.
I don't believe you guys.
You are fully grown men,
and you can't do
anything for yourselves.
You are just so helpless.
Gee, I wonder
how we got that way?
What's that supposed to mean?
Every time we try
and do something,
You say,
"it's easier if I do it myself."
Yeah. We'd be happy to do stuff,
but you always take over.
It's like you don't want us
to do anything for ourselves.
You know what?
You're right.
We are?
I guess I just wanted you
to stay kids
for as long as possible.
Because I grew up with a crazy mom
and two sisters to take care of,
I was doing dishes and laundry
when I should have been out
riding bikes and
throwing water balloons.
I wanted...
you to have a childhood...
ut I let it go on too long.
So I'm sorry.
This is my fault.
But...
it is time for you to go out
and start your own lives.
Okay.
Okay.
But before we go,
can you make us an omelet?
Yes.
Actually, no.
But I'll teach you to make one.
Pretty impressive.
You're thinking about
Charlie, aren't you?
Maybe I need something
to get my mind off of him.
How about a movie?
You shouldn't have
to get your mind off of him.
He's your son.
That's why you need
to move to Florida.
No. That was a bad idea.
I already told you
I'm not going there without you.
Long-distance relationships
don't ever work.
That's true.
Unfortunately, you're in one
right now with Charlie.
Face it.
One of these relationships
Isn't going to make it,
and it has to be ours.
Well, here's the only
problem with that.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Good.
Then you know
why I won't leave.
Here's what I know.
From the first day we met,
I have been pretending
that our age difference
doesn't mean anything.
Because it doesn't.
It does.
It means I have lived through
more of life than you,
including having children,
which is something
you desperately wanted and
now you have.  Bree, come on.
And while I have
fallen in and out of love
with several men in my life,
I have never fallen out
of love with my children.
And you may think that you will
never love another woman
like you love me,
but I know that you will.
I don't see how that's possible.
That's because you're young.
You have given me
so much, Keith.
Please...
let me give this to you.
Hi there.
We'd like a table, please.
I'm sorry. You're looking
at a 2-hour wait.
Susan?
Um, do you think that
you could squeeze us in?
Because I have a dialysis
appointment in an hour.
Oh. Um, it's just...
we're so slammed.
Just like my kidney.
Let me see what I can do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there.
Why is she getting
a table before us?
We've been waiting 45 minutes.
Sir, she's lost
both of her kidneys.
A booth would be great.
Well, I'm a diabetic, and
my wife has rheumatoid arthritis.
You don't see us trying
to get any special treatment.
You don't understand.
I'm on dialysis.
Arthritis... diabetes...
dialysis, so...
Unless somebody here has ebola,
I think we should get
the next table.
You think there isn't
anybody in this place
who doesn't have something?
We all have something.
I have restless leg syndrome.
Shut up.
The only thing special about you
Is you think you're more special
than the rest of us. You're not.
Now get to the back of the line.
You, too, sister.
She used to be married
to a yankee.
Nothing?
Okay.
I hope you know
this means you're paying.
I got to sit down.
I... I don't feel well.
Nice try.
We're not getting a table.
Really.
I... I don't feel well.
Oh, Susan, get up.
No one's even looking.
Susan?
Susan!
Oh, my god.
Someone call 9-1-1!
Are you going away?
No.
You are.
Paul! Come on!
Stop! What are you doing?
I want you out. You hear me?
Why? What have I done?
I know.
What?
I know who you are.
Paul, please, listen to me...
At least Felicia had the guts
to hate me to my face. You hid it.
I don't hate you. I don't.
Get out, you lying bitch.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay. Yes.
I did lie at first,
and, yes, I hated you,
because she told me to.
Get out!
But that changed.
You changed me.
I don't care what
she says anymore.
Please, paul. Forgive me, please.
I love you.
I swear to god, I love you!
No, you don't.
No one could ever love me.
Don't forget your gun.
Leaving is never easy,
but the time comes
when we must move on...
so we can leave
our childhood behind...
so we can let go of the past...
so we can be a good parent.
Yes, leaving is never easy,
wspecially for those
who have nowhere else to go.

Previously on
Desperate Housewives...
I don't feel well.
Susan's health
took a turn for the worse.
Someone call 9-1-1.
You have given me so much, Keith.
One relationship came
to a bittersweet end.
I know who you are. Get out!
Forgive me, please.
Please! I love you.
No, you don't.
And another ended in betrayal.
The suburbs are full of parents,
and each parent
has their own style.
There's the disciplinarian...
the smotherer...
and the negotiator...
But the one thing
they all have in common...
is they love to judge
the parents next door.
Take your sister inside, sweetie.
I need to have
a little chat with Lee.
Hi! I see Jenny's
practicing again.
Two hours a day,
five days a week.
Wow. She is really
into that violin.
Sometimes. Mostly I have
to force her to do it.
Ohh. Big mistake.
Really? Seems like you have
an unsolicited opinion.
Look, I know you're new
to this parenting thing,
so I'm gonna tell you
how it works...
You can't force
a kid to do stuff,
'cause then it just leads
to a lot of door slamming
and name-calling,
and then the kid gets angry, too.
Well, here's the way
I think it works...
Jenny told us she wants
to play the violin,
so it's my job to make sure
she sticks with it.
By pushing her.
I'm not pushing her.
What? She wanted
to learn mandarin.
Look, I don't mean to devalue
the two and a half weeks
you've had as a father.
I'm simply telling you what works.
So let me ask you...
what's Juanita pursuing on her own?
Huh?
As you know, the school
talent show is coming up.
Jenny's playing the violin.
What's juanita going to do?
Well, that's hard to say.
See, the beauty of my method
is that Juanita has explored
so many... things,
it's hard to know
which one to showcase.
Well, this should be interesting...
Two different parenting philosophies
and a talent show to prove
which one of us is right...
in front of hundreds of people.
Yes. Will it be the overbearing,
hypercritical father...
Or the loving mom
who still looks hot in these sweats?
Game on.
Hey, sweetie, I heard
the talent show's coming up.
What are you gonna do?
Oh, it's going to be great. Watch.
Yes, each parent
has their own style.
But deep down,
they're all afraid
they're doing it wrong.
Sync by YYeTs.net
There are many things
that bring us pleasure...
baking for our friends...
having a good laugh...
donating to charity.
But the things
that bring us pleasure
may not be enough
to give our lives meaning...
Without someone to love.
Morning, dear.
Just back from the store.
What the hell?
I thought for dinner I could
make those lamb chops,
you love so much.
I got a great tip from the butcher
on searing the meat first.
I kicked you out of this house.
Oh, dear.
You're still angry with me.
But you know, Paul,
every couple has their fights.
And I'll admit, ours was a doozy.
That wasn't a fight.
That was the end.
Y... you don't mean that.
You're just upset.
But don't worry.
We will get past this.
Are you out of your mind?
You actually think
I would take you back?
Wait. I get it.
This is another ploy
cooked up by your sick mother.
My mother.
Yes.
She's the one you're mad at.
It's all her fault.
She told me you were a monster
who killed aunt Martha.
But then I fell in love with you.
And I realized...
you never could have
done such a thing.
It was all a lie.
Oh, Beth. That was no lie.
You don't mean...
My God.
Now we both feel betrayed.
Painful, isn't it?
You know what this is?
Uh, a closet?
No. It's a graveyard...
A graveyard filled with
all the stuff we bought
because you told us you wanted
to do something and then quit.
Remember this? Remember how
you begged us to buy you a guitar?
The strings hurt my fingers.
What about this?
Very expensive.
You've never touched it.
That's not true.
I use it to pretend
I'm playing guitar.
Juanita, you are full of ideas,
but you never see
any of them through.
Well, guess what? You are doing
one of these things at that talent show.
But I'm already doing something.
Not that.
Fine. If you won't
pick something, I will.
Tap.
No.
Yes.
You enjoyed it. You actually
set your personal record
for sticking with something...
two months!
But it's hard.
Let me tell you
something about life...
Anything that's
worth doing is hard.
That's what life is?
You're going back to that tap class,
and you're gonna practice
two hours a day,
seven days a week
until you nail it.
No, I'll do something else
at the show.
Like what?
I'll tell jokes.
A Jewish guy and
a Mexican walk into a bar...
No.
Thank you, Bree.
It always brightens my day
when you invite me to visit.
Well, reverend Sykes,
I very much enjoy your company.
As I do yours.
So... have you killed someone?
Excuse me?
I've always found the treats
you prepare for my visits
are a reliable indicator
of your level of spiritual turmoil.
The more exquisite
the baked goods,
the more anguished
your soul. This...
Is a hazelnut chocolate
chip scone with currants.
So I ask again...
have you killed someone?
No. It's just...
lately I feel like Job.
You know, Job,
from the Old Testament?
I'm familiar with the book,
thank you.
Why do you think you're Job?
I just feel that God
has taken everything away from me.
I lost my business,
my children never call me,
and... my boyfriend
Keith has left me.
Well, it's not exactly
body boils and dead camels,
but I understand what you're saying.
When I complained
after I was not accepted
into Yale divinity school,
my father had no sympathy.
Instead, he drove me
from our lovely home in Connecticut
to a dangerous section of the Bronx
and forced me to hand out
blankets to the homeless.
I see. That's the reason
you've always been
so sensitive to the plight of the poor.
Perhaps.
It's certainly the reason
my father was buried
in a sport jacket he detested.
The point is, looking at
what has been taken from us
is a bad way to go through life.
Looking for what we can give
to others is far better.
Could you pass me the tape?
I'm so glad I asked you to help.
I'm sorry. I'm feeling a little faint.
What is that smell?
It's like sneakers
mixed with cologne
mixed with "I ran around the block four
times wearing a shirt made of cheese."
That's Porter and Preston.
Well, get the place cleaned.
Yeah. I think I'm gonna
hold off on that for a while.
Why?
Because...
I kind of love this smell.
Okay, now you're
becoming delirious.
We've gotta get you out of here.
Hey, you don't have children,
so you don't get it.
But raising kids is
an amazing experience.
It is the most meaningful
thing I've ever done.
So anything that reminds me
of them is a good thing.
You must be pretty sad
they're gone.
No.
No, it's right.
They're moving on
with their lives.
It's wonderful.
Then why are there
tears in your eyes?
Um... that's the smell.
You're right.
Let's get outta here.
So... any idea
what's going on with me?
As much as I enjoy
passing out at restaurants,
I'm starting to get
a little concerned.
According to these tests,
your creatine levels are increasing.
That's not good.
Oh. Why is that happening?
I realize this isn't
a satisfying answer, but...
we don't know.
So, uh...
how serious is it?
I'll tell you what I tell
all my patients...
We are going to do everything
we can to get you a kidney.
But in the meantime,
live your life.
If there's things
you're thinking about doing...
do them now.
I think for our anniversary
we should have a picnic...
in the woods...
where we got married.
Sure.
That's a great idea.
I think we should do it now.
But our anniversary's
not till July.
Were we not at the same
appointment just now?
I thought that dialysis
was supposed to keep you healthy.
I guess it's just
not working for me.
How bad is this?
Pretty bad.
Yesterday, the doctor's secretary
handed me this free parking pass
with this... sad look.
It was like,
"yeah, you're doomed,
but your parking's free."
So is this pass good for a month? A week?
Gaby!
I just wanna know
what we're facing here.
All I know is...
I need a new kidney,
and there's nothing I can do
till they find me one.
Well, have you thought about
trying to find a donor yourself?
So far, you've only asked family.
Yeah, widen the circle.
Ask friends and neighbors.
Well, there's not much point.
I mean, finding a match
is like 1 in 1,000.
So ask a thousand people.
Yes. We can help.
We can canvass the neighborhood,
put up signs, go door to door.
Guys, it's a vital organ.
Susan, people care about you.
You might be surprised
what they're willing to do.
I appreciate the thought,
but I just can't ask anyone
to make that kind
of sacrifice for me.
I can't.
I'm gonna get you more coffee.
Maybe she can't.
But I can.
Donate a kidney?
Have we met? I'm like 112.
But, Karen, it's for
our dear friend Susan.
I'm not having elective surgery.
I take enough risk
just climbing out of the tub.
I don't know.
Aren't there serious risks?
Actually, the mortality
rate is quite low.
I meant the scarring.
I've spent a lot of time
at the gym working off
my love handles, and I will not
give up a chance to go shirtless.
No.
But I...
No.
She's really...
No.
Would you ju...
No.
Bree...
Yes?
No.
I want a baby.
Here.
I also have a 9-year-old.
One of my own.
Preferably a boy...
and in brown.
Wait.
You're serious?
Where did you get
this incredibly rash
and not-thought-out idea?
From you.
You know what you said yesterday
about kids giving your life
meaning? I want that.
I want... meaning.
In the form of a baby?
Mm.
Exactly.
I already made an appointment
with an adoption agency,
which was right next door
to my manicurist.
It was like it was meant to be.
Are you sure about this?
I mean, your social calendar
is very full.
A baby would change all that.
It requires a lot of sacrifice
and compromise.
Maybe the way you do it.
Excuse me?
You work your life
around your kids.
I intend to work
my child into my life.
No offense, but I think
you make it a lot harder
than it has to be.
You know what?
You might be right.
But before you commit
to being a mom,
why don't you give it
a test drive?
What do you mean?
You could watch Paige some night.
Tom and I haven't
been out in a while.
Really? You'd let me babysit?
Yeah!
Which one is Paige?
This one.
I accept. Wow.
My first step toward being a mom.
Oh, you watch.
I am gonna be a natural.
Oh, uh, does she eat shellfish?
Maybe.
So I got us caviar,
shrimp pte, smoked salmon.
If there's a part of a fish
they can overcharge for,
we have it.
Can you put these in the back?
Thanks.
Sweetie?
Yeah?
I just want to thank you for doing
this today.  You're welcome.
And you can thank me again
when we go back in July
for our real anniversary.
And I'd really love if,
for the next eight hours,
I'm not sick.
No talk of kidneys.
Let's just have a fun,
normal day, okay?
You got it.
One fun, normal day
in the woods, coming up.
Nothing's gonna ruin this trip.
Hey. How was tap class?
It's too hard.
I don't wanna do it anymore.
Oh, sweetie...
You're doing it.
We're not a family of quitters.
Ugh! You quit all the time.
Yesterday we played
hide-and-seek.
Celia and I looked
for you for an hour
before we saw your car was gone.
So I found a great hiding place
at the shoe store.
It's not quitting.
All right, look,
let me ask you something...
Are you getting better?
I guess.
Well, there you go.
Now go upstairs and change.
Oh, and remember,
tomorrow's lesson's two hours.
You're gonna make
my feet fall off.
I can't wait for this to be over.
Why are you working her so hard?
It's a lousy school talent show.
You think Bob and Lee
are going easy on their kid?
No! They push her.
That girl's so good at the violin,
she's practically Asian.
So that's what this is about.
You're competing with Bob and Lee.
Pfft. That's ridiculous.
This is about Juanita.
I'm building her self-esteem
and giving her a chance to shine.
And if a couple of
same-sex parents
end up crying at home
in their silk kimonos, so be it.
Oh, Mike, look at this place.
Isn't it as beautiful
as you remember it?
Yeah. Lucky I didn't leave it
on the roof of the car.
Ugh. Will you forget
about the picnic basket?
I guess you're right.
What's important is we're together.
And there's no...
Damn it! They forgot the fries!
Unbelievable.
Okay, Mike, look at me.
Think back eight years,
when we stood in this spot
and we pledged
our love to each other.
Oh! I know.
Let's renew our vows.
That's a great idea.
I, Mike Delfino,
promise to love...
I, Mike Delfino, promise to...
It's just a bird. Forget it.
Promise to love and honor...
Okay.
Now he's just mocking me.
Mike!
Mike, stop!
Oh, my God.
I... I can't believe
you hit that bird.
Yeah, I know.
I was aiming for that one.
As the gayest person
at this brunch,
I feel it is my duty
to say... "fabulous."
Yeah, Bree, what's the occasion?
Oh,
nothing, just a little
get-together for friends.
Smoked salmon tartare cornucopia?
Mmm.
This feels weird.
She's up to somethin'.
Oh, what are you talking about?
It's just a brunch.
Excuse me. If I could borrow
a moment of your time
for a brief presentation.
Oh, God, you're right. It's an ambush.
Mm-hmm.
It seems many of you
have some misguided ideas
about kidney donation,
so I have invited Craig Lynwood,
transplant coordinator
at Fairview Memorial
to dispel some of those myths.
Mr. Lynwood, is it true
there's an age limit to donating?
No, not necessarily.
And does the surgery
cause unsightly scarring?
It's laparoscopic.
The scarring is minimal.
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you,
but I find that very reassuring.
So now that we have the facts,
I am sure you'll all
want to get tested.
Okay, fine. I'll go in next week.
No need.
Nurse Dearborn?
So the line forms over here.
And we won't take no
for an answer.
You're gonna get tested?
No. I think I can take Gaby.
I don't know how Paul
found out, mama, but he did.
And then... well...
he threw me out.
He was just... so cold.
What a sad story.
If only someone had warned you
what a bastard he is.
I know. You were right all along.
I should have listened to you.
But I'm going to make it up to you.
Oh, Beth.
I can't allow you
back in my life.
You have failed me
in every possible way.
No. I didn't.
Paul confessed.
Really?
Did you get it on tape?
Did he write it on a napkin?
Of course not.
Because you have never
done anything right
in your life.
Give me another chance.
I'll do anything.
I have no more use for you.
Good-bye.
Wait!
I have nowhere to go.
What's going to happen to me, mama?
You're going to live
a lonely, depressing life
in some ratty apartment
with plenty of time to think
about all the people
you disappointed...
most of all... me.
Guard, I'm done here.
Take her off the visitor's list.
The Oakridge School talent show
will start in five minutes.
So... checking out Fairview's
answer to Itzhak Perlman?
I don't know what that is,
but if it's German for
"cat strangler," then yes.
It's like that, is it?
So when's your daughter
start stomping off to Buffalo?
She's on right before Jenny.
So you might want to keep
your sunglasses handy, because
Juanita is going to be dazzling.
Honey! Are you okay?
Were you being chased by a bee?
No, it's my routine.
That's the first time
I've nailed the finale.
Oh, that... that was you nailing it?
To the floor. Bam!
Performers to the stage.
Well, uh...
Where are my tap shoes?
I don't know.
I left them right here.
Oh, honey. I guess you lost 'em,
and the show's about to start.
Dang it!
I can't believe this.
I was so excited. I worked so hard.
I'm sorry. You want to stay
and watch your friends?
We can go after for ice cream.
Who cares?
I will see your shirt
and I will raise you one bra.
Nicely played.
Do you hear something?
Hmm. Probably just
a peeping raccoon.
Oh.
No. No, I think
there's someone out there.
This way! There they are!
What the hell?
I got him!
Identify yourselves.
Are you northern agitators?
Do we look like
northern agitators?
W... we're just
celebrating our anniversary.
You guys...
playing paintball or something?
No, madam, we are not playing.
I am Major General Jedediah Garrett
of the Confederate Army, and we are...
Kevin... Kevin... Kevin.
Hi. Hi.
Uh, we're part of a
civil war reenactment group.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Get a real life, right?
Can't you guys just have
your pretend war over there?
Pretend?
You, sir, are interrupting
the Battle of Fredericksburg.
Actually, we have
the entire park until 6:00.
Kyle, show 'em the permit.
I... i... it's fine.
We believe you.
No, it's not fine.
This is really important to her.
Just give us a couple hours.
No, sir. Now begone!
Men, we must be ready to attack
the enemy should they attempt
to retreat into Maryland.
What a douche.
A douche, you say?
Yeah.
Mike! Let's just go.
Eyes closed, Kyle.
You're supposed to be dead.
I died with my eyes open.
It happens.
Close 'em, Kyle.
And now to close our show
is a violin solo
by Jenny Hunter-McDermott.
She lives next door to me.
We're getting those
double-paned windows.
Okay.
Ouch!
Poor Lee. He must be
pretty embarrassed.
Does he look embarrassed?
She always stumbles over that part.
She really stumbled over it today.
But she powered through it.
We couldn't be prouder.
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Nobody move!
Okay, don't leave yet.
There's still, uh, one girl
who hasn't performed yet.
But I lost my tap shoes.
Oh, that's right.
Oh... oh, hey! Wait!
Is that them in the back room,
behind the radiator?
Aah!
Whoo! Bravo!
Oh, look, we had a great day.
Think of it this way...
now we have a funny story
to tell people.
Two funny stories?
Hello?
Bree, it's Craig Lynwood.
I have some great news.
All your efforts have paid off.
You found a match?
We found two.
Oh, my God.
It's a miracle.
Who are they?
Well, one of them is you.
Bree? Are you there?
I'm sorry. It's just, uh...
I... I wasn't expecting this. Um...
Who's the other one?
Woman named Beth Young.
Beth? I didn't even
know she got tested.
Apparently she saw one of your flyers.
And she wants to do this?
Well, I don't know yet.
We're having a hard time
getting in touch with her.
So... should we continue
to look for this Beth Young,
or is the donor going to be you?
Fancy. I thought we were
just gonna grab a burger.
Renee was really
talking this place up,
so I thought we could splurge.
Or we could stay home
and eat money.
We better order. Any second,
my phone is going to ring,
and Renee is gonna beg me
to rush home and get Paige.
I don't know.
She might surprise you.
Oh, great.
One night out and
we have to listen to that.
Who brings a baby
to a place like this?
Hey. Let's give the parents
that dirty look that we always get,
like, "huh."
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
It's Renee...
on a date...
with our baby.
Unbelievable.
And you thought
she'd be good at this?
Ohh, look at that.
What? What is she doing now?
Nothing. The filet mignon
just went by. It looks amazing.
S... so should we just
go over and get Paige?
Not yet.
I want to watch.
Look, look, there you go.
She's probably ordering
milk for Paige.
Or she's giving our baby away.
Wow. She really is bad at this.
Ugh!
Excuse me.
Oh, hi. I'll be right over
to take your order.
Why did that woman
give you this baby?
She gave me $100 to see
if I could calm her down...
But I don't mind.
I love children.
I'm actually expecting my third.
Really? That's beautiful.
Listen, how would you like to make...
$200?
Are you ready to order?
Uh... have you
forgotten something?
Oh, your drinks will be right out.
No, no. Not the drinks.
The baby.
I gave you a baby.
Where is it?
Oh, I had orders backing up,
so I gave it to a busboy.
What? What busboy?
Um... he should be
here somewhere.
Oh, I hope he didn't finish
his shift and go home.
You better find me that baby.
Or I'm gonna take that one now!
Uh, hey, busboy.
Are you the one that has a baby?
I'm looking for a baby...
2 feet tall, big head, drools.
I'm looking for... a baby.
Um... did anyone pass you a baby?
Has anyone seen a baby?!
Had enough?
In a minute.
That vein in her head
is really going.
Do you know
where there's a baby?
Because they gave it to me.
I don't know where the baby is!
Lynette...
and Paige.
How... did you get Paige?
What are you doing with Paige?
You took our baby on a date.
Well... Brian called.
It was his one night in town.
Well, then you say,
"sorry, Brian, I can't make it tonight."
That's what being
a mother is about...
making sacrifices, something
you know absolutely nothing about.
Ugh! Come on, Tom.
Beth? It's Bree Van De Kamp.
Um...
coming.
I, uh, went to your house.
Paul told me you were here.
We aren't together anymore.
I'm so sorry.
It is what it is.
Thanks...
for checking on me.
Well, actually,
the reason I came by...
has the gentleman
from the transplant office
reached you?
Why?
Am I a match?
Yes.
Wow.
So... what do I do now?
Is there someone I need to call?
Are there forms?
Well, that won't be necessary,
because I'm a match, too.
What?
I know.
Two in the same neighborhood.
We're very blessed.
Anyway, I, uh,
am going to be Susan's donor,
but I wanted to thank you for...
getting tested.
When you moved onto the Lane,
I didn't give you a chance.
I saw you as a woman
who married a man I hated,
and I see now that you're
so much more than that.
I'm sorry it took me
so long to realize it.
Well, I...
I should go.
I want to do it.
Beth, no...
Please, Bree.
Let me help Susan.
It would really mean a lot to me.
Beth, what I'm about to say
may not make sense to you,
but, um...
I've been going through, uh...
a dark time...
feeling alone and unconnected
and wondering if I have a purpose,
so for me to be able
to do this for my friend...
It may mean a lot to you...
but it means everything to me.
Thank you for understanding.
Sorry about last night.
I bought this for the baby.
Wow.
Expensive, fragile, pointy...
if only it were flammable.
I'm not really cut out
to be a mother, am I?
No.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
It's not for everyone.
What's sad is how many people
go ahead and have kids anyway.
Well, what do people do
to fill up the hole in their lives?
No matter what I do,
no matter who I'm with, I...
I feel alone.
You'll find something,
and when you do,
you'll be glad you have the room.
Lots and lots of room.
Thanks. Mm.
I'm so glad I stopped by.
Hey.
We're about to eat.
Why don't you join us?
Okay.
Okay.
But keep the baby
on your side of the table.
What? I'll probably
let her play with my knife.
Ow! Son of a bitch!
Let me look at it.
No.
You okay?
Mike, are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
We never should have come here.
Instead of waiting
for our real anniversary,
we wasted our time
on this disaster.
Is that why you are yelling at me?
'Cause I...
'cause I moved up our anniversary?
Because you're dying.
You're dying,
and there's not a damn thing
I can do about it.
Look, I'm sorry, but it...
it feels like you're getting ready
to say good-bye...
like you're bailing on me.
Bailing?
I am fighting.
I... I am scared,
I don't know what's gonna happen,
but I am fighting my ass off.
I want to see M.J. graduate.
I want to grow old with you.
I want all of that.
But in the meantime, I...
I am gonna enjoy every...
every moment of every day.
Let's get outta here.
Hey. Lean on me.
I'm a lot stronger
than you think.
Our lives are brief.
That's why it's important
to search for meaning.
We find it in
our daughter's smile...
in the warmth of our friends...
or the comfort of our faith.
Okay, coming through.
Then there are those
who make their lives meaningful
by making a great sacrifice.
Hello. My name is Beth Young.
I'm here to donate a kidney.
I just found out I'm a match
for a friend of mine.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
You're in the wrong place.
You want the transplant office
on the fourth floor.
These are my forms.
I think you'll see
they're all completely filled out.
Again, ma'am,
you want the transplant office.
This is emergency.
My friend's name
is Susan Delfino.
It's funny. At first,
we didn't get along very well.
Actually, we never got along.
But that kind of thing
seems so insignificant
when someone is in need.
That's great. Fourth floor,
elevator's down the hall.
I really don't mean to trouble you,
but these forms have
to get to the right place.
I don't want to mess this up.
It's the most important
thing I've ever done.
Okay.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you so much.
You're very kind.
Wheelchair is on its way.
We need some help over here!
Sync by YYeTs.net
Previously on...
We are going to do everything
we can to get you a kidney.
In the meantime, live your life.
If there's things
you're thinking about doing, do them now.
Susan's condition got worse.
You're dying, and there's not a
damn thing I can do about it.
Beth was rejected by her husband...
I kicked you out of this house.
That was the end!
And abandoned by her mother.
I have no more use for you. Good-bye.
But Bree brought hope.
Has the transplant office reached you?
Am I a match?
Uh, yes.
I'm here to donate a kidney.
It's the most important
thing I've ever done.
And Beth made the ultimate sacrifice.
We need some help over here!
We can never know
the moment our lives are
about to change forever.
We might be preparing dinner...
coming home after a long day...
enjoying a glass of wine...
tending to our aches and pains.
And then...
when we least expect it...
the moment comes.
Hello?
Susan?
This is Craig Lynwood
from Fairview memorial.
Hello?
Mr. Young,
this is Dr. Jenkins from Fairview memorial.
We have a kidney for you.
What?
I'm sorry to tell you there's
been a terrible accident.
What kind of accident?
Your wife... shot herself.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
Mike! We have a kidney!
Is she dead?
We're keeping her on life support,
but I'm afraid there's no brain activity.
So... how soon can we do this?
How soon can you get here?
I don't understand.
If there's no brain function,
why is she on life support?
Your wife is an organ donor,
and we need to...
Stop.
You are not to touch her until I get there.
Yes, there are moments that
change our lives forever...
but not always in the way...
we might expect.
The women of Wisteria Lane
look for any excuse to celebrate...
A bottle of champagne
when you're not expecting...
A new dress, for turning 39...
again...
A triple fudge cake
to reward a personal best.
So when my friends heard
about Susan's good fortune,
they just couldn't resist.
Surprise!
What? What are you supposed
to say when someone gets an organ?
Kidney!
How about "Congratulations"?
We are so thrilled for you.
When is this happening?
I guess tonight.
So will you still be at my party saturday?
Because you did R.S.V.P.
Well, it depends.
Can you move the party into
the intensive care unit?
So that's a no.
Gaby's in charge of the guest list,
in case anybody else decides
to flake at the last minute.
Hello, Susan.
Well, I didn't know you'd
be bringing an entourage.
Well, it's a happy day on our street.
I would imagine, a bit of a sad one, too.
No, I can just call the caterers,
say there's one less person. No big deal.
Isn't that a little harsh?
I mean, she was a neighbor.
Who are you talking about?
Your donor, Beth Young.
Beth is her donor?
Wait, you... you don't know any of this?
Beth came to the E.R.
with the transplant papers,
and then... she shot herself.
Is she dead?
She's on life support,
but she's not gonna make it.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry. I-I thought you knew.
Her husband is with her now.
We want to give him some more time with her,
so we're anticipating a bit of a delay.
Oh, poor Beth.
I just saw her yesterday.
I mean, she seemed off,
but she always seemed
a little off, so I left.
How could I not have realized
she was in so much pain?
Oh, Bree, you couldn't have
known this would happen.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
It sounds like nothing's
gonna happen tonight.
Why don't you just all go
home and get some sleep?
Hello?
It's Karen.
Get your ass over here.
I got something that belongs to you.
Little hint...
it reeks of mai tais and
you gave birth to it!
I come downstairs to make breakfast,
and there he is,
passed out, stewed to the gills.
Again, Karen, we are so sorry.
If I wanted a drunk homo on my couch,
I would have married my college boyfriend.
You can let me go, all right? I'm okay.
Okay? You broke into a neighbor's house
and passed out.
I didn't break in. I...
I got a little confused, and...
went in the wrong house.
You got to admit, all these
places kind of look the same.
When you're drunk! Andrew, this is not good.
Calm down, all right?
I just... I just had a little
too much fun last night.
You need to be very careful.
Thanks to me, you have a genetic
predisposition to alcoholism.
What? Just 'cause you're one,
you want everyone in your little club?
I'm not an alcoholic, okay?
I got everything under control.
How bad is it?
It's really bad.
When did it start?
A while ago. First it was
just on the weekends,
then sometimes during the week,
and now it's every night.
I wish you had told me.
You know what I've started to do?
I pretend I have to work late,
so I don't have to come
home and deal with him.
Well, you need to talk to him.
I have,
and he promises it'll get better,
but it only gets worse.
I love him, but I can't take it anymore.
I know. It's very difficult.
No, Bree. I'm thinking of leaving him.
Please don't. Not yet.
Let me try to get him some help.
I'll talk to him.
No offense, but I don't think
you're gonna get through to him.
Don't be so sure.
I once smuggled vodka into church
in a "Jesus saves" sports bottle.
I can be pretty resourceful.
Tables and chairs go out back,
chafing dishes and flatware in the kitchen,
and eyes off the boobs,
but thanks for noticing.
Hey. I saw the party rental truck.
What's going on?
What do you think?
It's for our party tomorrow night.
Wh... our spring fling?
We're... still flinging?
Oh, why wouldn't we be?
Oh, I don't know. Unless the theme is
"Neighbors who blow their brains out,"
I kind of thought
the Beth Young thing might put
a damper on the festivities.
Why? She wasn't even invited.
Well, we can't ignore the fact
that one of our neighbors is dead.
Brain-dead. Big difference.
Besides, she seems like a clinger.
Bet she'll stick around for months.
So you think it's okay that
we still throw this party?
Gaby, it's not a party. It's an event.
Would you cancel the oscars? Christmas? No!
The invitations have been sent,
the caterer's been hired.
Life is for the living, so let's live.
Well, the living did buy a new dress...
Versace.
And I'm sure Beth would have loved
to have seen you in that Versace.
She would have, wouldn't she?
In a-in a way,
it could be a tribute to her.
And I did see the perfect
tribute shoes at the mall.
Now that is the spirit.
Now make sure the guests
know the party is still on,
and I will take care of
the arrangements here.
Oh, and, uh, maybe we could
have a moment of silence
and then a champagne toast in Beth's honor.
Oh, fabulous idea,
except instead of champagne,
let's do mojitos, and instead of Beth,
let's toast to us.
And the moment of silence?
Would sound great with music.
Oh. Sorry.
Please pick up 2-2-8-7.
Satellite pharmacy, please pick up 2-2-8-7.
Paul, I want you to know how sorry I am.
Can't imagine what you're
going through right now.
I want you to know how grateful I am
for this gift that Beth is giving me.
Obviously, it doesn't bring her back.
But I hope it will be a small comfort to you
knowing that in some way she'll live on.
Why would that give me comfort?
Are you trying to tell me
that my wife is dead and
that you're the consolation prize?
No, that's not what I'm saying...
I hate to disappoint you,
Susan, but my wife's not dead.
She's very much alive.
They told me there was no chance...
I don't care what they told you.
Beth is alive, and
I intend to keep her that way
as long as possible.
I'm not going to allow you
to strip her for parts
like some abandoned car.
That's not what's happening here.
This was Beth's idea.
Beth was not in her right mind
when she signed those forms.
As far as I'm concerned, they mean nothing.
And what makes you think
you deserve her kidney?
Was it those meals you shared with her?
All the girls' nights you included her in?
The little gestures of kindness you offered
to make her feel less alone?
Right.
You gave her nothing in life,
and that's exactly what
you're going to get in death.
I don't get this.
Beth signed the donation forms
and a living will.
Those are legal documents.
Aren't they binding?
Yes and no.
You're gonna have to do
a little better than "Yes and no."
Yes, they'll stand up in court,
but this hospital's not inclined
to wage a legal battle
against a grieving husband.
It's too delicate.
He's not a grieving husband.
Paul Young has a vendetta
against my family.
He's only doing this to make us suffer.
Look, we can't publicly support you,
but if you decide to take this on,
we won't stand in your way.
You're damn right we're gonna take this on.
No, we're not.
Susan...
We're not fighting Paul.
This is your life we're talking about here.
We can't let him win.
Win? His wife shot herself.
And you want to, what,
hire lawyers? Drag him to court?
I know that you're only thinking of me,
but this is Paul's decision to make.
It's not ours.
I just want to go home.
Thanks for helping me drop these off.
Yeah, no problem.
It's nice to be out of the house.
When did you start catering again?
Oh, it's nothing official,
just when I'm needed.
And who's the client?
Um... they prefer to remain anonymous.
Coffee? Doughnuts?
The old drunk guy from
outside the supermarket?
This is an A.A. meeting.
It's a wonderful program.
Lying to your son... which step is that?
I'm sorry.
But now that you're here,
why don't you give it a try?
Just listen to people's
shares and see if you relate.
And what am I supposed to say
when I get up there and talk?
"Hello, my name is Andrew.
My mommy brought me"?
No one has to know we're related.
Andrew, please.
Just one meeting. It could save your life.
Hey. I see you've met Bree.
My name's Tommy. Welcome.
First time?
Yes, first time. Uh, my name is... Elvis.
Elvis. Really? That's your name?
Yes, it's Elvis.
Yet another reason for me
to be mad at my mother.
Hey. How'd it go?
Ah, we would have played
better if there was a windmill.
Lynette, this is Glenn Morris,
C.E.O. of Morris technologies...
Oh.
And a man who can throw a 6-iron
farther than he can hit with one.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
So you guys want to come over for a beer?
Uh, you know what? I should go. Next time.
Bye.
See ya.
Well, nice to meet ya.
Hey, do you mind if I use the facilities
before I hit the road?
No. Come on in.
The bathroom's down there.
We have five kids. You might want to squint.
Actually, I don't need a bathroom.
I need a C.F.O.
What?
My chief financial officer
took a job in London,
and there's one name on my list
for his replacement... Tom Scavo.
Tom scavo... I know that guy.
Glenn, where'd this come from?
Well, Carlos is always bragging about you,
so I started asking around.
Come to find out everybody loves you.
What's not to love about Tom Scavo?
I'm prepared to give you
a very generous salary,
stock options, access to the company jet.
Wow, this is amazing.
But no.
Well, we just found something
not to love about Tom Scavo.
What?
Carlos is a close friend,
and we're just starting
our busy season.
I can't leave him in the lurch.
Look, Tom, I don't want to buy
a man out of his loyalty...
You could try. It never
hurts to put in an offer.
Lynette... Glenn, you have made my day,
but I gotta pass.
This conversation isn't over.
I hope you're gonna
talk some sense into this husband of yours.
Talk, beat, whatever gets the job done.
Okay. Now is when you wink,
rub your hands together,
and tell me you were playing
that man like a fiddle,
'cause this blank stare...
That's not fading is
scaring the hell out of me.
I'm not gonna screw over Carlos.
What's the matter with you?
Whatever happened to integrity?
Nothing.
It got a better offer from Glenn
and turned into prosperity.
Lynette, as much as I appreciate
you trying to run my life,
this is my decision, and I'm saying no.
Okay. Um... it looks like
we have a little time left.
Anyone else want to share?
Elvis?
It's not mandatory,
but we'd love to hear from you.
Elvis?
Oh.
Uh, no, thanks. I-I pass.
This is a safe place.
No one here is going to judge you.
Okay. You know...
when I hear you guys talk
about how other people try
to control your lives,
like, uh, Ed here with his boss
or... oh, Mary Ann with her... cat,
you know, I can relate.
You know, I have the same kind
of problem with... my mother.
You know, I-I think her
greatest regret in life
is the fact that she gave birth
to a son and not a puppet.
She's such a control freak
that my sister and I used
to call her "Attila the mom."
Could we not laugh?
I mean...
We're trying to heal here.
Nothing I ever did was good enough for her.
Like in the tenth grade,
I-I wanted to run for... for class president,
and the night before I was
gonna announce, she said,
"Are you sure about this?"
"You're not exactly a born leader."
Ouch. She sounds awful.
Or does she sound like a loving mother
trying to protect her son
from disappointment?
I don't think so,
'cause she wouldn't even
listen to my speech.
Well, maybe she was busy
preparing dinner for a family of
four with no help from her son.
Yeah, it is hard work making dinner
while maintaining an atmosphere
of emotional repression.
Well, if you ask me,
some emotions could stand to be repressed.
Uh, Bree?
I'm sorry, but we're here to
stop drinking, not criticize
the women who gave us life.
He's just trying to share.
Well, there is a difference
between sharing and whining.
Okay. Uh, we are definitely out of time.
Thank you, everybody.
Now let's just join hands and
recite the serenity prayer.
God...
Grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,
the courage to change the things that I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.
So I just wanted to remind you
about the party Renee and I
are throwing tomorrow night.
You're still having that thing?
A woman's on life support.
Exactly.
She's not dead. It's like you're
making my argument for me.
Put Roy and me down for a "No," But please,
call us when you have your
hurricane Katrina pool party.
So... Renee and I are
still having our party...
Are you nuts? In case you
haven't heard, our friend
across the street, Betty Young,
just blew her brains out.
Beth Young.
Oh. I got her name wrong. How disrespectful.
Oh, I hope you don't tell that
story tomorrow at your party.
It's just a little neighborhood gathering...
Gabrielle, what is wrong with you?
Oh, boy.
I know we didn't know Beth very well,
but we did know
Mary Alice, and this tragic
event has brought up a lot of
painful memories for all of us.
How could you not realize that?
Well, they can all go to hell.
We're still having the party.
Are you listening to me?
I got four "Are you out of your minds,"
three "You make me want to puke,"
and one "Maybe," from Lee.
The message is pretty clear.
Yeah. "Order less shrimp."
No. Renee, we can't have this party.
We should have canceled
the moment we heard about Beth.
Ah, nobody even liked her.
It doesn't matter.
It's in horrible taste.
Why can't we just change the date?
No! For ten years
I've had my spring fling
the first sunday of april,
not the second sunday, not the third,
and not when a bunch of wimps decide
they're ready to stop moping.
I'm not canceling the party.
But nobody's gonna be here.
Oh, well, we'll see about that.
My social life is not gonna
come to a stop just because
some cuckoo bird decides to
clean her ears with a handgun.
Wow. Thank you.
For what?
Making me the compassionate one.
Wow. Is he asleep already?
Yeah, he was exhausted.
Not even Harry Potter
could keep him awake tonight.
Look, I'm not trying to upset you,
and I'm not mad,
but I need to know why you won't
let me fight to get you the kidney.
I don't know. It's just, uh...
it just feels wrong.
Well, it shouldn't.
Beth wanted you to have it.
Exactly. She killed herself so
I could have her kidney. Why?
Paul's right. I never had
so much as a pleasant
exchange with the woman.
I don't know that the reason matters.
What matters is, it was her final wish.
But it doesn't make any sense.
I can't take her kidney, knowing that maybe
I'm the reason she's lying in that hospital.
Hey. Hey, I'm-I'm reading.
Oh, good evening, sir. Welcome aboard.
Can I get you anything before we...
take off?
Ooh. You could help me put
my bag under the seat.
Okay, you're not good at this,
so let me do the talking.
May I help you with your seat belt?
Oh, look...
You're already in
the upright and locked position.
What's the name of this airline?
I want to become a frequent flyer.
Oh, this isn't a commercial airline, sir.
Hotshot executives like you
only fly on the corporate jet.
Mmm.
Hey, L-Lynette?
Mm-hmm?
I'm-I'm not taking that job.
Ugh.
Well, then you'll be handling
your own bags from now on.
Lynette, we talked about this.
I-I won't leave Carlos in the lurch.
Okay, great. You're loyal. I love that.
But your stock went way up today.
If you're gonna stay put,
at least could you try
to get something out of this?
Well, I could tell Carlos about the offer,
see if he'll match the number.
Match the number?
Oh, look...
A seat just opened up.
I wondered if you would come.
They told me at the hospital
that you're trying to have Beth
declared dead and
her life support turned off.
Yes.
Well, that's not going to happen.
It has to.
Why?
Because she's dead.
No, she's not.
My daughter's dead.
Your wife is dead.
And we both know what killed her.
If you're trying to blame me for this...
if this is your last attempt
to use her to hurt me...
No. We don't get to use her anymore, Paul.
This... sick game you and I play,
this hate we hurl at each other
has finally found a victim...
the only innocent person in the game.
I did nothing.
You refused to believe she loved you.
I turned her away because she did.
And now she's gone.
She...
Maybe she can recover.
I believe she can. You must believe it, too,
or you wouldn't be in here praying for her.
I'm not praying for her.
I'm praying for forgiveness.
We did this to her, Paul.
Now we have to stop.
And we have to let her rest.
Hi. Can I come in?
Sure.
I'm on my way to a meeting
and I was hoping you might join me.
Look, the deal was one meeting, mom.
I went and I'm done.
You won't go back? Even for me?
Nope. Elvis has left the building.
Look, I don't need to go,
all right? I'm fine.
I hope you know that
"I don't have a problem"
is one of the biggest
clichés in our playbook.
Don't get me wrong.
I have plenty of problems.
I-I have no job.
Alex works these crazy 18-hour
shifts at the hospital.
What's my day?
Long, endless stretches of nothing.
I work out. I do laundry.
I-I dusted the other day...
actually dusted and felt proud.
How pathetic is that?
I don't find that pathetic.
I know you don't.
Look, the one thing that gets me through
is-is knowing that when
the night rolls around,
I can just have a few drinks and kick back.
And as long as I don't hurt anyone,
I think I'm allowed.
Mom, trust me.
I'll be okay.
If you say so.
What?
You listen to me.
There's been a terrible
tragedy in our neighborhood.
A woman felt desperate and
alone and killed herself
because nobody cared enough to help her.
And the thing is, I was there.
I saw that something was wrong...
and I walked away.
And I am never gonna let
myself do that again,
and certainly not with you.
Alex left me.
Oh, my...
I guess he just got sick
of living with a drunk.
Oh, sweetie.
What did I-I do?
I-I wrecked my marriage.
Look, it's gonna get better.
I promise you it's gonna get better.
But for that to start,
you need to go to a meeting.
I can't get up in front
of a bunch of strangers
and talk about this.
Then... we can have a meeting right here...
just the two of us.
What do you say?
Wow. Well, that's Glenn for you.
He's nothing if not aggressive.
Carlos, I swear I didn't seek this out.
I know you didn't. And you're
a stand-up guy for telling me.
But it is a very generous offer,
and I figured if that's
my value in the marketplace,
that maybe I should be...
Doing a little better here.
Look, our friendship aside,
you are a valuable part of this company.
And if I had the cash...
you know I'd step up.
But...
You know how rough things have been.
You've seen the empty desks.
We just can't offer you that kind of money.
But I don't want to lose you,
so here's what I can offer...
title bump to chief marketing officer,
car allowance, and...
profit participation.
How's that sound?
It sounds like a bunch of crap.
Ugh. Lynette.
Of course he pleaded poverty.
Did you play hardball? Did you grind him?
Yes! That's how I got profit participation.
Tom, I worked at that company, remember?
At the end of the year,
Carlos takes the excess cash
as a bonus, so there is no
profit to participate in.
What else did he offer you?
A bogus new title?
Not-not bogus!
Chief marketing officer. C.M.O.
A-and a car allowance.
Oh, that's great.
"Here's your allowance, Tommy.
Good luck on your paper route."
You are over the line, Lynette.
And you are walking away from
real money and real power
for pretend profits and a made-up title.
Carlos might as well call you
"King of all important things"
and give you a pile of Monopoly money.
Why do you keep pushing like this?
'Cause if I don't, you go nowhere.
Wow.
So that's where you think I am?
Nowhere?
Oh, my god. You're not gonna take that back?
I think you are an amazing
husband and father.
But as a businessman...
You're 46 years old
and you're still trying
to establish yourself.
Opportunities like this don't
keep falling from the sky.
You gotta grab 'em.
By stabbing my friend in the back?
Do you think Carlos
would hesitate for a second...
if the roles were reversed? Not a chance.
That's how he got where he is.
He's ruthless.
You wanna see me get ruthless?
Watch what happens if you don't drop this.
Wow. This is some crowd.
Told ya. Well, I'm pretty close to capacity,
so you're gonna have to scoot along now...
Well,
I'm just stunned so many people came.
Well, just shows you how little you know
about the party circuit elite.
Oh.
Wait. Is that the guy from animal control
who picks up dead birds?
What? No.
Uh, these are mostly people
I've met through the years
in the Caribbean.
Mrs. Solis? I was going to call you.
Is it okay if I clean your pool
on thursday instead of wednesday?
Of course. I mean,
if you think you'll make it back
from St. Barts by then.
Ugh! Don't give me that look.
A good hostess knows the best parties
have a mix of people.
Honey, the only mix I see
is the cotton/poly blend
on every dress in this room.
Excuse me.
Renee!
Renee, look, I...
Hey, you two!
Beat it!
You have a cool house.
I don't get it. Why have a party
when the people you really
want are too sad to come?
Well, I'm not sad,
and I'm not gonna pretend to be.
Renee! I know you didn't like Beth,
but come on. She's dying.
And whose fault is that?
Everyone keeps acting like this
horrible thing happened to her.
It didn't just happen.
She did it to herself.
But think about how much
pain she must have been in.
Everyone has pain.
But only a selfish bitch checks out
and passes it on to everyone else.
Beth didn't care who she hurt...
her mother, her husband, her daughter!
She didn't have a daughter.
Well, amen for that, at least.
Honey, you told me your mom died
when you were young.
You never said how.
Uh-huh.
Did she take her own life?
What do you think?
Damn it.
How hard is it to fill an ice bucket?
You know, I lost a parent
when I was a kid, too... my dad.
I'm not making comparisons here,
and I understand if you
don't wanna talk about it.
Good, 'cause I don't.
But I think that if you do...
Do what?
I'll feel so much better
if I let it all out?
Well, that doesn't work for me.
I'm not a hug-and-learn kind of gal.
No, I guess you're
a throw-party-and-forget kind of gal.
Look, I will never forget
what my mother did.
I think about it every day.
But I refuse to let it be what defines me.
This spring fling might seem
shallow and insensitive to you,
but it's my way of saying I choose life...
over death.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've gotta get back to my lame-ass party.
Wait.
It's not a lame-ass party anymore...
because I'm here now.
0 to 60 in under 5 seconds,
top speed of 160, and no cup holder...
'cause you'll want both hands on the wheel.
Sweet.
Can I take it for a test drive?
Oh, it would be our pleasure.
Oh!
So is the car for you? Your husband?
Actually, no.
It's for our neighbor.
Hey, sweetie.
Is something wrong?
Guess who's got a brand-new slap in the face
parked in front of his house?
What are you talking about?
Carlos. The day after he cries poor to me,
he goes out and buys himself
a $70,000 lotus?
I think the Evora runs around
$76,000, but what do I know?
You were right, Lynette. I'm a pushover.
I'm being loyal to a guy who does nothing
but look out for himself.
Wow. You must feel really betrayed.
I got half a mind to call Glenn right now
and take that offer.
I say... use your whole mind and do it.
Glenn?
Tom Scavo.
I am in.
Yes!
Yeah, yes! I am excited, too.
Well, you wanna have lunch tomorrow
and hash out the details?
I will see you then.
Feels good, huh?
Feels real good.
You know what's gonna feel even better?
Telling Carlos to go screw himself.
No! Wait! Wait!
Don't try and stop me!
I'm gonna tell that guy
just where he can stick his Evora.
Okay, but before you do, it's not Carlos'.
Ahem. I borrowed it from the dealer
and I parked it there.
What?
I know. I'm sorry.
It sounds very bad,
but I did it for a very good reason.
That you can manipulate me into
doing whatever you want?
Carlos didn't buy that car,
but he could have without
even feeling it because...
he's the kind of guy
who doesn't let a good
opportunity get by him.
Meanwhile, you're his dutiful number two,
staring down the street
at a car you wish you had.
Get in. We're taking it back,
then I'm calling Glenn.
Just one...
Get in.
Tom, this could be you... driving this car,
living this life,
being that guy.
I understand if you wanna
say no to all that,
but I don't even think
you've asked yourself,
do I want it?
It would be better
if you didn't talk right now.
Whoa.
I can't tell if we are gonna drive...
or fly.
What time does this have to be back?
He said 4:00, but
they don't close till 6:00.
I'm guessing we could be a little late.
Yeah. Let's be a little late.
Hello, Susan.
Would it be okay if I came in for a moment?
Uh, actually, I was...
Sure.
I've never been to your apartment.
Yeah, well, it's not much.
No, it's-it's quite nice.
I'm on my way to the hospital to see Beth...
to say good-bye.
I've alerted the transplant office
that we'll be moving
forward with her request.
I'm sure as soon as I sign the papers,
they'll be contacting you.
I don't understand.
You're getting your kidney.
I thought you said...
Susan...
I would be very grateful
to you if you could...
forget a lot of the things that I said.
You were right, Paul.
I was terrible to Beth. I was.
I never gave her a chance.
I never tried to get to know her.
Why would she do this for me
when I did nothing to deserve it?
Beth didn't love people
because they deserved it.
Believe me. I know that.
I'm so confused. I...
I don't know if I can accept.
Please... honor Beth's life
by allowing her to make you well,
for your son...
for your family...
for your friends.
Okay.
Thank you.
Paul...
Yes?
I am so...
very, very sorry about your wife.
Yes.
I am, too.
There comes a moment
when our lives change forever...
the moment we admit our weaknesses...
the moment we rise to a challenge...
the moment we accept a sacrifice...
or let a loved one go.
And sometimes...
the change in our lives...
is an answer to our prayers.
Ms. Tillman?
Thought I'd find you here.
So sorry for your loss.
Thank you, Warden.
I'm sure this is small consolation,
but I've just heard from the parole board.
They've decided to grant your request
for humanitarian release.
Ironic, isn't it?
My daughter had to die so I could go free.
Again, my condolences.

I need a C.F.O.
I'm prepared to give you
stock options,
access to the company jet.
Tom got a job offer
he couldn't refuse.
I am in.
Yes!
At dialysis, Susan made a friend.
Beth took her life,
which led to Susan
getting a kidney...
Honor Beth's life by allowing you
to make her well.
And Felicia being freed.
I just heard
from the parole board.
They've decided

Alex left me.
Oh, honey.
I guess he just got sick
of living with a drunk.
And Bree helped her son
face his addiction.
When Bree Van De Kamp
decided to stop drinking,
her recipe for sobriety
was the 12 steps
of alcoholics anonymous.
She admitted she was
powerless over alcohol...
She asked God to remove
her shortcomings.
She made a list of all the people
she had harmed.
So when her son Andrew
decided to stop drinking,
Bree was pleased to see him
follow those steps
as successfully as she had.
Let me see it again.
Ahh. 30 days sober.
I am so proud of you.
I feel great, mom.
And it gets better all the time.
Just keep going to meetings
and working those steps.
Yeah, I kind of stalled out
around number eight, though.
Ooh, that is a tough one.
No one likes to make lists
of people they've done harm to,
particularly with
your penmanship.
No, I wrote the list.
But now I have
to make the amends,
and there's one person
I've been really awful to.
Well, I know it seems difficult,
but give it a chance.
Some people are more forgiving
than we give them credit for.
You thought I meant you?
Well, of course I did.
Aw, mom.
Uh, no offense,
but you're way down the list.
I think you're, like, seventh.
Seventh?
I'd like to know about
these six people ahead of me.
Did you steal their pocketbook?
Did you wreck their car?
Stick a kitchen knife through
an oil portrait of them?
Okay, calm down.
I will not calm down.
I resent you thinking you've
harmed anyone more than me.
Well, I have.
And if I'm gonna make amends,
I need to start now...
with the top of the list.
And who might that be?
Who is this victim number one?
Mr. Solis.
Yes, Bree was diligent
about following the 12 steps.
After all, I did sort of kill his mom.
But even she could
recognize a step too far.
Andrew, stop!

We teach our children
to apologize when
they make a mistake.
We tell them that it's wrong
to blame others...
or pretend it never happened...
or try to cover it up.
But there are those times
when apologizing...
Hey, Carlos! You got a minute?
Is the biggest mistake of all.
Be right there.
Andrew, stop. You really
need to think about this.
Mom, you know
what the step says...
Make direct amends
to those we have harmed.
Unless to do so would
injure them or others.
And if Carlos finds out,
trust me,
he's going to injure others!
Hey, buddy. What's up?
You know, there's something
I never told you...
Uh, yes. How wonderful
you were to him after Rex died.
You were like a...
surrogate father.
Oh, I don't know about that.
You were.
You took him on hunting trips,
football games, car races...
I didn't know you were gay then,
or I'd have thrown in a few musicals.
Ha ha ha ha!
The point is, you've always
been so kind to people,
never inuring them... or others.
Well, that was the same year
that my mom died,
so I was working
through some grief, too.
It was great that we could
be there for each other.
So... that was what
you wanted to tell me?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, just, uh... thanks.
No problem.
Someone just earned another pie.
Hey!
Whoever's in here,
I own this house,
and I want you out now!
Well, hello, Paul.
What the hell
are you doing here?
I'm just nosing around
to see what I'll need
to buy before I move in.
Not much, apparently.
I had no idea
the place came furnished.
Have you lost
what's left of your mind?
This is my house!
Now get out!
Oh, I know you bought it.
You bought a lot of houses
on this street,
but you didn't want
people to know,
so you put this one
in Beth's name.
So what?
I was her husband!
And since she never made a will...
Oh, but she did, Paul, years ago.
And according to that will,
I own this house
and everything in it.
Oh, my goodness!
Is this a Gustav Stickley?
Do you really think
the people on this street
want a manipulative
psycho for a neighbor?
Well, they let you live here,
so I'm guessing the zoning laws
aren't all that strict.
If they wanna shun me, let them.
I won't be alone.
I'll have my daughter with me.
My God. You stole her ashes?
I did not steal them. You are
so quick to think the worst of me.
I just went to the mausoleum
and I explained my legal rights.
Your rights?
What about my rights?
She was my wife!
Did I say you couldn't visit her?
Drop by anytime, Paul.
My door is always open.
Everything looks great, Susan...
Your blood work,
creatine levels.
You're, like, the poster girl
for kidney transplants.
Does that mean I can have
salty food and sex again?
Salt in moderation.
You should wait two more weeks
before resuming
normal sexual activity.
Mike and I have already
waited a month.
There's not going to be
anything normal about it.
Okay, well, I'll see you
at your next checkup.
Where are you off to?
Well, I am definitely
going to the mall
to enjoy the last few hours
of my handicap placard.
First I'm going
to the dialysis center
to visit my friend Dick Barrows.
Oh, you don't have to go
to the dialysis center.
He's here in the hospital.
He was admitted yesterday.
Hey, tall, dark, and jaundiced.
Delfino.
Come closer.
I wanna see if you still have
that new kidney smell.
What are you doing here?
Where else can you get
a large Jamaican nurse
to give you a sponge bath
for 4 grand a day?
Another viral infection.
I'm sorry.
I can't believe you got
a kidney so fast.
I don't suppose you have
any more suicidal neighbors
with donor cards?
I didn't laugh when you wrote it
on my get-well note,
and I'm not laughing now.
I'm telling you, you are
the luckiest person alive.
You should take advantage.
Do you gamble?
A little.
Ah. Oh-ho, great.
When I get outta here,
I'm taking you
to that casino by the airport.
I've never won in that place.
You could be my rabbit's foot.
I'm not big on casinos.
I'm more of an
around-the-kitchen-table,
gossip-with-my-girlfriends,
win-all-the-M&M's kind of gal.
Ah, it's time for my spinal tap.
You see?
You're not the only lucky one.
Hey, babe.
You're home late.
I got called down
to the legal department.
Is everything okay?
There's no easy way to say this.
Oh, no. What is this?
That, my dear...
is my signing bonus.
$100,000.
No way. It is not $100,000.
"One..."
It is. It's $100,000!
I can't believe it!
I know!
What are we gonna do with it?
Um, how about this...
go to the bank,
get 100,000 singles,
and roll around naked on them,
and then apologize
to everybody at the bank
and come home!
I like the naked part.
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!
Okay. Okay, let's think. Um...
Obviously, we should put some
in the kids' college fund,
and then top off
our retirement account...
Or actually start
a retirement account.
Definitely.
We should do all of that...
with 90 grand.
The other 10
is for you to spend
on something fun
and totally frivolous,
like a mink vest
or a diamond frisbee.
No, no, no...
No. Lynette, do you know
how long I have waited
to be able to say this to you?
Go crazy.
It's on me.
Fine.
If you're gonna be
a jerk about it,
I'll spend $10,000 on myself.
Aah!
We should celebrate!
Mm. Let's go out to dinner. Mwah.
Oh, definitely. But not tonight.
I've got a ton of work.
Okay? How about Friday?
Okay. It's a date.
Wait a sec.
"One..."
Nope. That's $100,000.
And I'll call.
9, 10, Jack, queen, king...
a straight.
Eat it!
I was going to say how nice it is
to have you back in our game,
until you so charmingly
told us to "eat it."
For the third time.
I'm sorry.
I've just never been
this hot before.
My friend called it today.
He said I was on a lucky streak.
Well, you are lucky.
You got a kidney transplant.
And if you take any more
of my money,
you're gonna need
a face transplant.
Okay, is anyone going to notice
what's different around here?
You cut your hair?
No.
Well, you should.
I mean the coffee.
Tom gave me part
of his signing bonus
and said, "go crazy," so...
I bought a grind and brew
coffee master.
Wasn't even on sale.
Check me out.
Shall I say it?
No, please, allow me.
You're pathetic.
You finally get
a little mad money
and you buy
a kitchen appliance?
But I don't really need anything.
Oh, honey, look around.
You need everything. Two.
Ll, it's hard for me.
Tom's only had this job a month.
I'm used to clipping coupons
and buying in bulk.
I even color my own hair.
Ah. Mystery solved.
Hey.
How did you let this happen?
Don't look at me like that.
I tried. I tried for years.
I couldn't even get her
out of flip-flops.
Oh, maybe I can
take a shot at her.
Don't do it.
She'll break your heart.
Well, I'm bored.
Look, after this game,
I am taking you
to a clothing store...
That doesn't also sell
patio furniture and meat.
I'm out.
I'll bet $20.
I'm all in.
You didn't even look
at your cards.
I don't need to.
So what do you say,
Van De Kamp?
Did you come to play?
Huh. Let's see
what you are made of.
Three kings.
Oh, look at me!
I should buy a lottery ticket right now.
Yes, you should,
and then you should "eat it."
I so don't belong here.
That saleslady knows it, too.
Did you see the look
she just gave me? Come on.
What?
Wait.
Um, excuse me.
We'd like two prosciutto panninis
and a couple of iced cappuccinos.
There's a café across the street.
Oh, please don't make me go
to the enormous hassle
of buying this place
just to fire you.
Nice.
Now let's get started.
Oh, you have got to try these on.
Nah. I don't...
I don't need boots.
You will once you try them.
Ahh.
It's like the boot
is French kissing my foot.
Walk around in them.
Oh, dear.
What they are doing
to my feet now...
I can't even say.
Oh.
Now... try these.
$500 for jeans?
I wouldn't pay that if they
had $400 in the pocket.
Try them.
Look at my ass!
Where did that ass come from?
It came with the jeans.
Ohh!
You like it?
Ohh!
You should see the ass
that comes with the $900 pair.
Do I even wanna know
how much that is?
You just want to put it on.
Thank you for shopping
with us, Mrs. Scavo.
Uh, that dress should be
altered by tomorrow.
We open at 10:00.
Let's make it 8:00.
And... bring croissants.
Hey, Bree!
I hope Andrew
brought his rain gear.
I hear it's gonna pour up there.
Up where?
The cabin.
What are you talking about?
Didn't Andrew tell you?
He came by this morning
to talk to Carlos.  He did?
Yeah, Carlos was just leaving
for a hunting trip
and invited Andrew to come along
for old times' sake.
Andrew is with Carlos
in the woods with guns?
I have to call him.
Why? Is something wrong?
Oh, yes, something's wrong.
Has Andrew lost his mind?
I tried to talk him out of it,
but he's taking this
A.A. thing seriously.
Okay, see, this is the problem
with sobriety... it ruins lives.
Damn it. I still can't get through.
There's no reception up there.
I'm starting to get scared.
Oh you're scared?
I'm gonna be the one
raising two kids
with a husband in jail for murder!
And Andrew's gay, so it's a hate crime.
That's ten more years!
Let's not panic. It may not be
too late to stop this.
You're right.
We have to get up there.
I'm gonna see if Lee
can watch the girls.
And I have to get something
out of my nightstand.
Bree, aren't there gonna be
enough guns up there?
When one of them is in my hands,
then there'll be enough guns.
I just want to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved yesterday.
You're sorry?
I'll give you two reasons
I don't believe you.
I knew you'd be upset to find
you'd bought me a house.
But I still had to twist the knife.
I guess old habits die hard.
You think that's what upset me...
the house?
And Beth's ashes, of course,
but I wanna make that up to you.
You're giving them back?
No. I don't think
either of us should keep them.
I think we should scatter them,
together.
So you've picked up on the fact
that I long to spend
more time with you.
There's a pretty little lake
about an hour north of here.
When Beth was a girl,
it was her favorite place.
I think she'd be happy there.
You could just do this on your own.
Why do you want me there?
Because Beth loved you.
It's what I think she'd want.
And I don't have a car yet.
Shall we say tomorrow
around 10:00?
10:00 will be fine.
Shall I make us some sandwiches?
If it's all the same to you, Felicia,
I'll bring my own.
Dick, are you awake?
Oh, good.
You were right
about the lucky streak.
Guess who won at poker?
Are you looking for my Uncle Dick?
Uh, yeah. Did he go home?
No, um...
I'm afraid we lost him last night.
What?
Oh, my God.
Yeah. He never let on
how sick he was.
I'm Wally, by the way.
Susan.
Susan Delfino?
Uh, he left somethin' for you.
.
He was always bugging me
to go out to that casino with him.
Now I wish I'd gone.
Bree, Gaby,
what are you doing here?
He's not here.
Where's Andrew?
He's hiking over by the cliffs.
In the rain?
Well, it wasn't raining when he left.
Why'd you two come
all the way out here?
We were worried about Andrew.
Because he... forgot his medicine.
So when is he gonna be back
from his hike?
Soon, I hope. Those rocks get
awful slippery when they're wet.
Oh, my God! Is that blood?
Yeah, I cut myself chopping wood.
What's that?
A shovel?
With fresh dirt on it!
Why is there fresh dirt?
Damn it, Carlos.
What did you do to Andrew?
What are you talking about?
Don't pretend!
We know he came clean
about your mother!  My mother?
It was an accident!
He didn't mean to run her over!
You should blame me!
I'm the one who helped him
get rid of the car!
Mom?
Andrew!
Oh, thank God you're all right.
What's going on?
You killed my mother?
What? No. No, who said that?
We thought you told him.
In the woods alone?
What am I, crazy?
Well, you weren't here,
and we saw blood...
And the shovel with fresh dirt!
Explain that!
Do you see a bathroom in here?
You son of a bitch. Carlos!
I'm warning you. I have a gun...
In the car.
Park ranger!
Come in, please!
Hey.
Sorry you people picked
such a lousy weekend
to enjoy our park here.
Actually, we were just leaving.
Oh, 'fraid not.
Just got a radio call.
Big old pine tree just fell
across the access road.
We can't clear it up till tomorrow.
So you're gonna have
to sit tight till then.
You mean we have
to stay here all night?
Yep!
I got a deck of cards in my truck
in case you get bored.
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.
Ahh.
Here. In case you're planning
to put your champagne
in a paint bucket.
I think I'm good.
Wow.
The sad caterpillar has turned
into an extravagant butterfly.
I am checking Tom's E.T.A.
so I know when to preheat the oven,
and I'm not talking about... cooking.
I'm talking about...
Uh,
I know what you're talking about.
Please stop.
Hey, Mr. C.F.O.,
the kids are gone,
the champagne is on ice,
and my bra actually
matches my panties.
I was just gonna call you.
I'm on my way to the airport.
I've got to get to Montreal
tonight on the jet.
What? No.
No, this is our celebration night.
Can't you reschedule?
I'm sorry. I can't.
I'm a hero for landing this meeting.
I got to be there.
Fine. I'll take another rain check.
You're starting to owe me
a lot of rain, you know?
I love you.
Travel safe.
Hey. Get your mitts off that.
We'll have it tomorrow
when he gets back.
Oh, Lynette.
Tomorrow it'll be something else.
Tom is a big shot now,
and the bigger he gets,
the less you're gonna see of him.
Hey...
you want the clothes
and the jewelry
and all the other perks.
Well, this is what they really cost.
You came to the funeral.
What?
My mother's funeral.
You sat in the second row,
behind the family,
consoled us all.
What was that like?
Kind of... funny?
Of course not.
It was very awkward.
Awkward.
Gosh.
So sorry her funeral
was so tough on you.
God, I'm so hungry.
Can't believe you guys
didn't bring any food.
Actually, I brought something.
This is all the dinner I need.
Oh, great. We've got tension
and firearms. Let's add alcohol.
Carlos, please put that away.
Andrew's only been sober a month.
I heard.
A whole month without a drink.
You must be thirsty.
Help yourself.
No, thanks. I'm... I'm good.
Okay, let me put it this way.
To mama Solis. May she rest in peace.
Are you gonna drink to my mom?
Or you gonna insult her memory?
I... I guess I'm gonna drink
to your mom.  Yeah.
Carlos, stop it.
You have every right to be angry,
but please, think of all the years
we've been friends.
Friends?
You think that we're still friends?
How long have I watched you
play miss high-and-mighty
to the whole damn street?
And the whole time,
you were just covering your ass!
Hey. Get mad at me,
not the people
who just knew about it.
People?
Who else knew about this?
That's not important.
Gaby, what was that?
Nothing. It was a moth.
You knew.
Her I can understand,
but my own wife?
Oh, for God sakes, Carlos,
let it go. This is ancient history.
Not to me.
I mean, not a day went by
that I didn't think I should have
found the guy that did it.
Well, I didn't have to look far, did I?
I was taking him to ball games,
inviting his accomplice
to dinner parties,
and my wife knew.
You know what?
To hell with all of you.
Wait. Carlos,
where are you going?
Anywhere but here.
I don't trust myself
to be in the same room
with you people.
Carlos!
Carlos!
Carlos!
Ladies and gentlemen...
please discontinue use
of all electronic devices
so we can begin our meal service.
What are you doing here?
We are about to take off.
Not anymore.
I pushed your flight back...
half an hour.
You... what? How?
Well, let's just say your pilot's
back at the terminal,
having coffee with
a few dead presidents, so...
now it's just you, me...
oh, and two unfortunate lobsters.
Hey, you know what
you can do on a private jet?
Anything.
Absolutely anything.
I can't believe you did this.
I know. What a wife, huh?
No, no, no. No, I mean
it's really gonna screw me up.
I'm supposed to sit down
with my team the moment I land.
I need every second
to prep for this meeting.
I understand.
You have been working so hard.
I just wanted you to have
half an hour of fun.
Thank you,
but you need to realize...
this is fun.
Honey, I love this job.
I have never felt
so valuable before.
I... I walk into a room,
and people stop talking.
They want to know
what Tom thinks.
I got to tell you,
this company is a rocket ship.
It's taking me
on the ride of my life.
Wow.
That's...
I am really happy for you.
And don't think I have forgotten
why I have this gig.
You gave me the confidence
to jump at it,
and I am so, so grateful.
This is all 'cause of you.
Can... can... yeah.
What? Oh.
Back to fun?
Uh, I should take this.
I'll... I'll call you when I land.
Okay.
You look great, by the way.
Oh.
Hey. I got a little hung up
on the ground, but I'm on my way.
While I got you on the phone, um,
who is gonna be in
on this conference call?
Yeah... no.
N... n... not Ted.
I... I want to try to keep this...
Susan.
Roy.
I didn't know you came here.
Every Thursday,
Karen sticks 50 bucks in my pocket,
pats me on the butt,
and tells me not to come home
till I blow it or double it.
So slots?
I can't speak for those two,
but I think Lottie gets around.
No. Slots.
Oh! Oh, yeah. Hey, sit down.
Oh, thanks, but, uh,
I'm gonna try the poker room.
Oh, you don't want
to go in there.
Those guys are just
a bunch of sharks.
I'm sure I won't be here long.
I'm playing for a friend.
100 bucks?
You're an honest woman.
When somebody gives me
money to gamble,
I pocket it and tell 'em they lost.
Except you, Lottie.
You actually lost.
What's so funny?
Just wondering what Beth would
think if she could see us now,
driving along like
we're off to a picnic.
I think she'd be glad.
Our hate was what killed her.
She couldn't please either of us
without hurting the other,
so she just walked away.
So maybe she's thinking,
"oh, great. Now they get along."
Or "better late than never."
Tell me something, Paul.
What?
Did she suffer at the end,
in her last conscious moments?
I don't know.
I wasn't there when she died.
No, I didn't mean Beth.
I meant my sister.
You were there for that one.
For God sakes, Felicia.
I've wondered
about this for years.
I'm not wearing a wire, Paul.
And I'm not gonna frisk you
to make sure, so let's drop it.
Think about it.
We both saw someone
we love be destroyed.
First my sister drove
your wife to kill herself.
You admit that? Finally?
Yes, Paul, I do.
You loved your wife,
so you killed my sister.
I loved my sister,
so I tried to destroy you,
and who paid the price for it?
Beth.
I just hope that
by doing this together,
we can put a stop
to this awful cycle,
and reach some sort of... closure.
I'm all for closure.
Well, I lost my $50,
but I ate my weight in shrimp.
So all in all, a good day.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
Yeah, you got a little left.
What's that, 60 bucks?
Good for you, kid.
Those are $1,000 chips.
I'm all in.
$1,000? Y... you bet $6,000?
What are you, nuts?!
She's nuts.
We're taking these back.
Hands off the table, sir.
Grandpa must know something.
I'll call.
2 pair, kings over 4s.
Three aces!
The kid had three aces!
Susan, you won over $12,
I know.
I just...
keep...
winning.
And you cry every time.
You're weird.
Susan, what's wrong?
My friend...
Your friend is gonna be thrilled.
You just won for him.
He died yesterday.
He wanted me to come here.
He said I was on a lucky streak.
And he was right.
I am.
But...
Why?
Why do I keep winning
while other people lose?
And why did I get a kidney
while good people died?
It doesn't make any sense.
I served in Korea with this guy,
Joe Dansak...
Funny as hell, he made
whiskey sours in his helmet.
One day, we're out on patrol.
I felt something whizz past my ear,
I turned and looked,
and Joe was on the ground.
He was dead?
Yeah.
That night, I asked the sergeant,
"why was it him and not me?"
He sort of shook his head
and said, "why ask?"
So you're trying to tell me...
that it is... random.
I'm trying to do anything I can
to get you to stop crying, honey.
You're on a lucky streak.
Who knows why?
Just enjoy it.
But what happens
when my luck runs out?
I know.
"Why ask?"
Why ask?
How about right here?
What do you think, honey?
Is this a good spot?
Would you stop talking to the urn?
You're creeping me out.
Must we bicker? I thought
the point of doing this together
was to make a fresh start.
Do you really think I'm that stupid?
That just scattering some ashes
is gonna make me trust you?
Ugh. I know you don't trust me, Paul.
It's why you brought a gun.
What?
You're not gonna deny it.
Okay. So what?
You show up at my house and say,
"hey, let's go to the woods together."
I'd be crazy not to bring a gun.
I know... and I'd be crazy
to let you keep it.
What?
How did you get that?
Prison's not a very nice place to live,
but I did pick up a few skills.
I just brought that
for self-defense.
So now I'm supposed
to believe you?
See, that's our problem, Paul.
How do you trust somebody
who doesn't trust you?
You fear me, so you bring a gun.
I fear you, so I take it.
Where does it end?
Just put the gun down.
It could end right here
with me shooting you
just so I can sleep easier.
Go ahead. Shoot me.
At least I'll die knowing
you'll rot in jail forever.
Oh, I don't think so.
I'll plead self-defense.
It is your gun, after all.
You pulled it on me,
we struggled, it went off.
I could kill you right now
and go scot-free.
Or I could do this.
I don't want you dead, Paul.
And I don't want us
to fear each other.
I just want this over.
Don't you?
I think you should do the honors.
Well, just keep looking.
It's not that big a forest.
Finally! Next time you drop
your girls off for a few hours,
you might mention you may not
be home that night.
The roads were closed.
We we trapped in the woods.
Could have been worse.
Could have been at my dinner party
when I tried to serve the tiramisu
and the "tira" had been licked off.
Look, Lee, I'm sorry, okay?
My guests were another
gay couple who were thinking
of adopting a child.
They're not anymore.
Lee, cut me some slack.
My husband is missing.
Don't try to play me.
Carlos called this morning.
He did?
Yeah. He asked if
I could watch the girls
for a few more hours
while he drove out to Littleton.
I said, "why not?
I have very few breakables left."
What's he doing out in Littleton?
I know. Come on.
What? No, wait. Gaby, wait!
I'm hungry.
Of course you are.
You'll be pleased to know
that Paul was very touched
when we scattered the ashes.
He even teared up
a little at the end.
'Course...
He thought it was
really you in the urn...
not just some sweepings
from the fireplace.
But I would never scatter you
in the woods.
No. You're going to stay
where you belong,
right here...
with me.
And don't you worry out Paul.
I'll make him pay
for what he did to you.
But not just by shooting him, no.
That's too quick, too...
merciful.
No.
Death is the easy way out.
But look who I'm telling.
Oh, Carlos...
thank God you're okay.
You really scared us.
Aw. Flowers for your mom.
How sweet.
Save it, Gaby.
You never liked her.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I didn't see why
she had to be in your life so much,
why she couldn't just let go.
But I wasn't a mother yet.
I didn't realize you never let go.
Listen, uh, Carlos...
we are so deeply sorry
for what we did.
Andrew was only 16
and already abusing alcohol,
a habit that he learned from me,
so I...
Quiet, m... mom, please.
I'm just trying to defend you.
I know. I know.
It's what you've always done.
And I've let you. That's why
my life has been such a mess,
but I need to do this.
This is between me and Carlos.
Just please, wait in the car, okay?
But, Andrew...
The car, mom!
Bree, let's go to the car.
I'm gonna make this right.
You can sue me.
You can go to the police.
Whatever it takes.
I know this must hurt.
I'm not hurt.
I'm proud.
Sit down.
Yes, whenever we make mistakes,
we need to apologize,
and then we need to move on.
We must try to accept
the changes in our lives...
Or choose to trust
an old enemy,
or learn to stop fighting
our children's battles.
But sometimes the pain
we've caused is so great,
there is no moving on.
Carlos, I want to thank you
for forgiving Andrew.
You are a generous man,
and I am so grateful to you.
May I come in?
You can go to hell.
Carlos.
Excuse me?
I did forgive Andrew.
He was a kid that made a mistake,
but you were an adult... my friend...
who covered up for him.
Carlos, please...
Mnh-mnh. Listen carefully,
because this is the last thing
I am ever going to say to you.
We are no longer friends,
not you and me,
and not you and Gaby.
You can't speak for me.
I just did.
No barbecues,
no cocktail parties,
no poker games.
You are not even
to wave to us on the street.
That's how it's going to be.
You can keep your muffins.

Previously on
Desperate Housewives...
Paul was shocked to find
Felisha was back on the lane.
Well, hello, Paul.
Tom's new job came with perks.
You know what you
can do on a private jet?
Anything.
A relationship was forced to end.
We are no longer friends,
not you and me,
and not you and Gaby.
You can't speak for me.
I just did.  And Susan got
her transplant, thanks to Paul.
I'm sure as I sign the papers,
they'll be contacting you.
After Susan Delfino's
kidney transplant,
her doctor ordered her
to abstain from sex...
for six weeks.
But what the doctor
couldn't prevent Susan from doing...
was dreaming about it.
These dreams were filled
with torrid caresses...
with passionate kisses...
and with soft cries of ecstasy.
Ahh.
The only thing missing
from these dreams...
was her husband.
Are you okay?
Uh... yeah, I just...
Had a dream.
Yeah, I know.
You know? What do you know?
Was I saying something? Was I talking?
More like moaning.
Oh, moaning! Oh, God.
Yeah, you mentioned him, too.
Oh, don't be embarrassed.
So you had a sex dream.
It's not surprising given
how long we've had to lay off.
Tell me... what were we doing?
Uh... we...
Hey, maybe we could recreate it
when we end our drought
in 2 days, 17 hours,
and 35 minutes.
Well, uh...
needless to say, it was
some pretty kinky stuff.
Like, did we--
did we do that thing--
that thing we talked about?
Mike, it was my dream, not yours.
Oh, God, I'm desperate.
Can you give me some details?
Uh... or could show you
in 2 days, 17 hours,
and 34 minutes.
That'll work.
I can't wait. We'll send M.J.
to Mrs. McCluskey's,
and have the whole night together.
Yes, Susan was having
dreams about sex.
Just the two of us.
Uh-huh. Just me and...
you.
And they were becoming
a nightmare.

The residents of Wisteria Lane
are nothing if not loyal.
They love their country.
They root for the home team.
They support their favorite brand.
But the fiercest loyalty
on Wisteria Lane
is the one between friends.
All right. I gotta run.
I'm meeting the girls for coffee.
Stop.
Which girls? Will Bree be there?
She better be. She's buying.
Then you're not going.
Wait. You were serious about us
never speaking to Bree again?
That woman satour table,
spent the holidays with us,
all the while knowing
her son ran over my mother.
Yeah, I'm serious.
Fine, then you stop talking to her.
But you're not gonna control me,
'cause I have the secret weapon.
You'll withhold sex? Please.
You always fold before I do.
That's not true.
The last time you tried,
you got so turned on
telling me what you
weren't gonna do to me,
you wound up doing it to me right then.
Damn it.
Well, you're still
not gonna stop me
from seeing Bree.
Yes, I am.
Our relationship
with that woman is over,
and I forbid you to see her again.
He forbid me.
Who is he to forbid me?
I mean, what is this, 19...
Whenever it was that husbands
got to forbid their wives?
Gaby, he has every reason to be upset.
I hate to say this,
but I think we should
keep our distance for a while.
What? I'm not giving in to this.
I've already caused Carlos so much pain.
I think it's the only thing we can do.
So what are you saying?
No more poker?
No more lunches?
No more shopping?
I'll miss it as much as you do.
Oh, really? Doesn't sound like it.
I think this is easy for you.
Easy?
I wanna come over there right now,
so you can drag me
to the mall kicking and screaming,
but we can't.
I have to go.
I have scones in the oven.
I love your scones.
Stop.
Good-bye, Gaby.
You're not hanging up.
But I have to.
Hey, Lynette! You're not gonna
believe this. I-  Shh!
I had to walk Paige
around the block
eight times to get her down.
Nothing is so important that
you need to raise your voice.
Not even this?
Weisman leadership conference?
Seriously?
You're invited?!
And so are you.
Oh, my God!
Warren Buffett
goes to this conference,
and Bill Gates and Oprah--
It's one of her favorite things.
Oh! Look at this!
All the great speakers.
Plus they've got the spa, and--
And no kids, right? No kids?
No kids.
Yes! Yes!
You take her.
I gotta figure out what to wear.
Hey, you two!
Thanks for watching him.
Hey, can you watch him again
on Wednesday? Mike and I are--
Yeah, I know.
Your big night, huh?
Mike told you?
Didn't have to.
I caught him staring at my cleavage.
So... post-transplant sex, huh?
If it's as good
as my post-cancer sex,
you're in for a treat.
Fingers crossed.
Hey, have you looked
at your old house lately?
It's kind of a wreck.
Does look a little neglected.
You should go over and
talk to Paul. I'll watch M.J.
Oh. I... can't do that.
Um, I mean, he might be
in the middle of something.
Or he might be hanging
from the showerhead.
Do me a favor and check.
'Cause if he's dead in there,
I live downwind.
Susan?
Paul?
Paul.
Uh... hi there.
Um... I-I was just
in the neighborhood,
and it- and it looked
like things were piling up,
and would you mind
closing that robe, please?
Oh, sorry.
And sorry about the mess.
I haven't been getting
out of the house much.
You look thin.
Are you eating?
Yes.
I'm fine. I'm a little behind
on my chores.
So if there's nothing else...
Paul, um...
are you sure you're okay?
Yes, Susan.
Fit as a fiddle.
Good-bye.
I've already spotted
two ex-senators
and three covers of "Forbes."
Everybody here is definitely A-list.
Oh! Bob! Lee!
Hey, hey, you fancy hotshots.
Hi!
Mwah.
Mwah.
Hiya. Hi.
Glad you've done
this conference before,
'cause I'm definitely
gonna need somebody
to show me the ropes.
Nothing to it. Just don't talk politics.
And don't push Warren Buffett
in the pool.
I didn't push him.
He got between me
and the margarita bar.
Oh, let me introduce you
to Barry Weisman.
Prepare to endure the single most
bone-crushing handshake
of your life.
Bye.
Come on.
Well, with this line,
it's gonna be hard to get drunk.
Lesson one--
The power of the words
"The president's council
of economic advisors
want their martinis now."
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's a little trick I learned
when I was too cheap
to buy my own newspapers.
How fantastic is it that
Chris Cavanaugh is speaking?
I thought "Flashpoint"
was the best business book
of the year.
I agree.
I've heard him speak before.
He's even better in person.
We're in for a treat tomorrow.
Meg Butler, president of Amtech.
Oh, um...
Uh, Lynette Scavo.
My husband is the C.F.O.
of Morris Technologies.
Oh. You're a plus one.
What's that mean?
Unfortunately, it means you
won't be seeing Chris Cavanaugh.
The seminars are only for participants.
Wha--
What am I gonna be doing?
I will tell you what--
japanese flower arranging.
Did I weep at the simple beauty
of my design last year? Yes.
Yes, I did.
I don't want to arrange flowers.
Why are they dividing us up like this?
Maybe it's because
some of us spent our lives
working our way up
the corporate ladder,
and others just
married someone who did.
Excuse me.
Oh, no. That's--
Wow. That is ridiculous.
I really want to see those seminars.
Hey, don't worry.
You are going to love
what they have planned for us.
Attention!
If I could have all
of my plus ones find a buddy,
we're going to get to know
each other with a scavenger hunt.
Bree.
Gaby. What are you doing here?
I just came by to talk to Lynette.
Oh, she's out of town.
She asked me to water the plants
and collect the mail.
Oh.
You look good.
You, too.
New coat?
You noticed.
I should go.
Can't you just stay and talk?
Maybe have a cup of coffee?
Gaby, we shouldn't.
It's just coffee, Bree.
But your husband...
He'd never look for us here.
Oh, come on.
It's been really hard
for me not seeing you.
Aw, it's been hard for me, too,
especially with Lynette out of town.
I mean, there's Susan, of course,
but lately whatever
topic you bring up,
she manages to steer it
right back to kidneys.
Tell me about it.
Well, I guess I...
could put on a pot.
I like mine with cream.
I know how you like it.
Hello, Karen.
Felicia. Hi.
When did they let you out?
About a week ago.
I just stopped by because
I wanted you to have this.
It belonged to my sister, and...
she was always so fond of you.
That's sweet.
It's my small way of saying thanks
for keeping my secret
all those years.
Yeah, not much a secret anymore.
Don't I know it.
But I've kept your secret.
I never told a soul about
your role that night,
and I never will.
Um...
It's not really a good time
to talk about that.
I understand.
But I hope you'll stop
by my place sometime.
We have so much
catching up to do.
Sure. I'll do that.
Uh, wh-where are you staying?
Haven't you heard?
I'm moving in next door.
We're going to be neighbors.
Who was that?
Just an old friend.
Old friend?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Make me a drink, will you, sweetie?
Toby!
Here, kitty, kitty.
Toby! Where are you?
Here, kitty, kitty!
Toby!
Oh, Felicia, help me out.
Ida Greenberg's lost
her stupid cat again.
What happened to you?
Is that blood?
You never saw me.
I have to go.
Your hand! Let me call you an ambulance.
You love my sister, right?
Martha? Y-yeah.
And you know Paul Young
murdered her?
There's no doubt in my mind.
Oh, my God.
Did you kill Paul?
No!
He killed me.
What?
They'll find my blood in his house
and my fingers in the car,
and he'll spend
the rest of his life prison
if you say you never saw me.
Don't ask me to do this.
Please, Karen!
Paul got away
with Martha's murder,
but... he won't get away with mine.
Toby.
Here, kitty, kitty!
Ikebana is all about bringing
together nature and humanity.
The three main branches,
or shushi, represent chi- earth,
ten- heaven, and jin- man.
Interesting.
Nothing to represent woman.
How about this insignificant
clump of moss?
We could stuff it down at the bottom,
where it will only speak
when spoken to.
Does my chi look a little droopy?
Did you hear me?
Yes.
Yes, Lynette, I heard you.
I heard you during yoga,
during the fashion show,
all through salsa dancing--
"Life is unfair."
Ol!
Well, I'm sorry, but I came here
to learn new things
and meet interesting people,
not to pretend that
putting sticks in a vase is art.
Are we still having a problem?
Yes, we still are.
Doesn't it piss you all off
that we're stuck in our gilded cage,
forbidden to go
to interesting seminars
just because we're plus ones?
No.
This is fun.
I really feel like I'm in Japan.
This is the United States of America
in the 21st century,
not some oppressive
patriarchal regime.
It may be small and red,
but this lanyard
is no better than a burka!
Oh, dear.  We need to storm the gates
and demand to be let inside!
If you're not gonna use the rest
of your flowers, can I--
Come on! Rise up!
If we do it together,
we will not be denied!
4:00, people!
I think you've all earned a cocktail.
No. No!
No, do not drink those!
Those are the--
the cocktails of oppression,
make from equal parts tyranny
and blind obedience, and...
Oh, screw it.
Mmm. This is the best
pineapple upside-down cake
you have ever made.
You know why?
It has an ingredient my cakes
have never had before...
Danger.
I know! Sneaking around
makes everything taste better.
When I was with John Rowland,
every sense was heightened,
it was like this...
Skip it. You wouldn't understand.
Oh, really? Wouldn't I?
What? You? No way.
Just because I don't trumpet
my indiscretions like you do,
doesn't mean I haven't had
a little walk on the wild side.
You cheated on Rex?
Of course not.
What do you take me for?
I cheated on Orson.
With who?
Karl Mayer.
Oh, my God!
He was a slimeball,
but he was hot.
Mm. We'd meet at this cheap hotel,
and as guilty as it made me,
I still felt this... tingle,
this frisson I'd never felt before.
And now this week with you...
it's back.
Hmm.
Just wish Lynette didn't have
to come home tomorrow.
Actually, that motel story
gives me an idea.
Gaby, I'm flattered,
but I really don't think we should--
Not that.
There's a great new spa
that just opened on Foster Lake.
We should go next weekend.
Do we dare?
I think we both know
the answer to that.
I went by our house today.
It's looking a little run-down.
Yeah? You want me to talk to Paul?
He's supposed
to be keeping the place up.
Uh, actually, I already did. Uh...
he seems kind of run-down, too.
Wh-what are you doing
talking to Paul?
Well, I was picking up M.J.,
and he came out of the house,
and... kind of worried about him.
Why? Who cares?
Mike, he gave me a kidney.
No, Beth gave you a kidney.
Paul did everything
he could to block it.
Yeah, but we talked,
and after, he seemed so sad.
I don't give a damn!
I know you feel bad for the guy,
but I don't trust him.
Please... just do me a favor
and stay away from him.
Okay.
Now can we talk about
something a little more fun?
Like our plan for sex night?
Okay, hold that thought.
I'm gonna take a shower.
May I come in?
Please.
Lynette, what are you doing here?
I thought you had a spa thing.
Oh, please.
I can get a face full of steam
standing over a pot of spaghetti
any night of the week.
I wanna see Chris Cavanaugh.
I know, and I asked,
and they said no.
The keynote speech
isn't for spouses.
They said they've got
other activities planned for you.
Activities that they plan for me?
Tom, I'm not a child.
I'm a grown-up.
I'll decide what I want to do.
Come on. Don't you know
how much I wanna see this guy?
Can't you pull some strings?
I don't have any strings.
When I've been five or six times,
then maybe I can ask
for a favor, but not now.
There you are.
Someone's been naughty.
Let's go, Mrs. Scavo.
I think it's somebody's spa time.
This is why you keep us drunk, huh?
So we don't fight back.
This hits the spot.
I remembered you like your coffee
same way you like your men--
strong... and Irish.
So how did you get out
of jail so soon?
Was it good behavior
or bad behavior with the warden?
Oh, Karen.
How I've missed your
frank and salty questions.
Actually, it was, uh,
what they call humanitarian release.
You see...
my only daughter
passed away just recently.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had a daughter.
Such a sweet girl.
So young.
She was barely 30 when she died.
I wish could have met her.
Actually, I'm pretty sure you did.
Her name was Beth.
Beth Young.
Can I... freshen that?
So we'll cut you back to ten
every other day
on the prednisone and take it from there.
Any questions?
I do have one.
Shoot.
Is it common for patients
to have sex dreams
about the husbands
of their dead donors?
I have to admit,
I did not see that coming.
Understand- awake, I have
no conscious desire for this man.
But in my dreams...
Susan, I'm not a psychologist.
But you went to med school.
You must have learned
something about dreams--
a course, a book.
Okay. What did you talk about
before you went to sleep?
I was talking about him.
Oh.
I mean, he's not doing
very well, and I got
in an argument with my husband
about whether I should help him.
Well, maybe the dream is telling you
to follow that impulse.
The man's wife died.
You're alive because of it.
It's natural to be concerned about him
and want to make sure he's okay.
Mike really doesn't want me
to talk to him.
It's your call, but my guess is your
dreams won't stop until you do.
When Paul went to jail,
his one goal was to make me
pay for putting him there,
so he wrote to Beth,
begging her to come see him.
He said he was innocent,
that he was a good man.
Paul's very charming when
he wants to be, and Beth...
she fell in love with him,
just like he knew she would.
Well, didn't you try to warn her?
Of course. She just said
I didn't know him like she did.
When he was released,
when he had defiled her,
the real Paul came out.
He said he'd never loved her,
that she was stupid
and that she didn't deserve to live.
S-so she killed herself...
just like he knew she would.
Bastard.
I hope you'll keep
this story between us
at least for now.
Beth would hate
for all her friends to know
what a fool she was.
Okay, but the one thing I don't get
is why do you wanna live
on the same street as that monster?
So I can watch him!
It's too late for Beth and my sister,
but I won't let him
destroy another woman
the way he destroyed them.
Well, you're not watching him alone,
because I'll keep my eye
on that S.O.B., too.
Now if you need anything--
anything at all--
you give me a call.
Oh, Karen.
I'm so lucky to have a friend like you.
Wonderful what a
4-handed massage can do.
One more hand,
and it would've been perfect,
but this ain't that kind of spa.
Yeah.
No, no, tell him he has a choice.
He can sign those papers before
I shove them down his throat
or after they come out the other end.
Yes.
I guess someone didn't see
the "no cell phones" sign.  No.
I guess that rule
only applies to plus ones.
I'll talk to you later.
I wanna grab a soak before
the keynote speech. Bye.
Oh, Ms. Butler?
Huh? Oh, hi.
Yes, I'm her. She's me.
Meg Butler. Meg.
Oh, we have a seat
for you up front.
Oh, uh...
Uh... great.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Now to introduce
our keynote speaker--
the president of Amtech,
Ms. Meg Butler.
Come up.
Come on.
Hi.
Those of you who know Meg
know... I'm not Meg.
Nutmeg. That's funny.
Uh, anyway... Meg asked me
to introduce Chris Cavanaugh
because she knows
what a huge, huge fan I am.
Where are ya,
ya big-brained rascal?
Oh, there he is.
Almost as hot
as his author photo.
Anyway...
Those of you who haven't read
"Flashpoint," do it immediately.
Put it in your kindle, your iPad.
I don't know. Buy the book.
It will make you smarter,
because what Chris Cavanaugh
has to say about human nature,
about creativity,
is absolutely--
There she is!
That's the bitch who stole
my lanyard and my clothes!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chris Cavanaugh.
Hi. I called you a bunch of times.
Your phone must be broken.
It is now. Please respect my privacy.
Paul, you have to let me talk to you.
Why?
Because you're a mess, and
someone has to do something.
And okay, I'm having dreams about us.
Dreams? What kind of dreams?
Regular dreams--
lots of daylight, lots of clothes.
Look, I'm your landlord.
I have a right to come in.
But I'd like you to invite me in.
Getting ready to cook something?
I see onions, potatoes,
this long green and white thing
with scary little hairs on the bottom.
This is food, right?
It's called a leek.
I was trying
to make potato leek soup.
I love potato leek soup.
Of course, that was before
I knew what a leek was.
You want some help?
Come on. Soup I can do.
Making soup? Is that what
we were doing in your dream?
No. No, we weren't.
That reminds me.
I need to wash my hands.
Hey. How was the big conference?
Okay.
You meet any guys for me?
I'm not picky.
You know what they say.
Ugly plus money equals handsome.
Well, apparently,
crazy plus wife equals laughingstock.
Uh, you two having a fight?
Yeah, kinda.
Well, you won't even know I'm here.
Tom, why don't we
finish this later?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you not wanna be embarrassed
in front of your friend?
Well, she just embarrassed me
in front of the whole fortune 500.
I don't know how many
different ways I can apologize.
At some point,
you're gonna have to let it go.
I kinda don't feel like
letting it go, Lynette.
It's not just the fact
that you humiliated me.
It's that after all those years
that I supported you,
took a backseat to your career,
you couldn't do the same for me.
What happened?
It was awful.
All weekend,
I was treated like a plus one,
a second class citizen, a--
A wife!
Lynette, in Tom's world,
that's what you are.
You're gonna have
to get used to it.
What if I don't
wanna get used to it?
Well, take it from someone
who spent eight years
being "Mrs. Third Baseman,"
you can be a wife...
Or you can be a first wife.
I'm home.
Hi, honey. How was your day?
Worked straight through lunch
and I'm starving.
What's this?
It's a pineapple upside-down cake.
Wow.
Reminds me of the cake
your old friend Bree
brought to dinner last month.
Huh. I-I don't remember that.
'Cause obviously Bree
didn't make this one,
since I don't see her anymore
because I know...
how you feel about her.
So... where'd this come from?
I... m-made it.
Really?
Hmm.
The woman who ordered in
Chinese food
for Christmas dinner made
a pineapple upside-down cake.
Well, it's not that hard.
It's just some pineapples and...
upside-down cake.
You know what?
This looks... so good.
I would love for you
to make me one...
just like it.
Right now?
Yeah, and I'm gonna sit here
and watch you...
every step of the way.
Sure. No problem.
Uh...
First, I'm gonna get some flour,
'cause you can't make a cake
without flour, right?
Oh, no! Got it all over me.
Maybe I should take my top off.
In fact...
why don't you and I go up
to the bedroom and--
Make the cake.
Well, you really are hungry.
Well, let me freshen up first.
He wants you to make
a pineapple upside-down cake--
The woman who ordered in
Chinese for Christmas?
Yes, we've already covered that.
Now what am I gonna do?
If I can't make this,
he's gonna know
I've been seeing you.
Just stall him.
I'll make one and slip it to you.
No, he wants to watch me make it.
Okay, don't panic.
We can do this.
How?
Okay!
One pineapple upside-down cake
coming right up.
First, preheat your oven to 300.
First, I'm gonna preheat
my oven to 300.
Then we're gonna start
with the caramel topping.
And then we're gonna start
with the caramel topping...
for which I will need...
sugar.
Brown sugar.
And butter.
How much butter?
Who are you talking to?
Uh... my... grandmother.
See, this was her recipe,
and talking to her
makes me feel like
we're making it together.
How much butter, grandma?
Quarter cup. Got it.
And?
It's very good.
It is?
Hot damn.
You know, truthfully,
I was just kinda winging it.
Oh, and if you don't taste the wine,
it's 'cause I drank it.
Ahh.
So last time you and I
had a meal together,
had to be...
before Mary Alice died.
That was a long time ago.
Maybe we should start
doing that again.
Susan... why are you doing this?
Why do you care?
M.J.! No running.
Ah, leave him alone.
It's nice to see something
moving fast in here.
Thanks. And just to warn you,
we... might be a little late
picking him up.
Yeah? Looks like
you're going to be
a little late getting started.
I remember a guy that
used to live on this street.
He taught my daughter to swim.
He made a killer barbecue tri-tip.
He had a laugh you could
hear three houses away.
I liked that guy.
I'm not that man anymore.
I think you can be.
Oh, you know, I'll be right back.
What the hell are you doing?
I asked you not to come here.
I know, but Paul is suffering,
and everyone else
has turned their back on him.
You know why?
'Cause he's a bad guy!
Look, you might
have fallen for his act,
but I haven't, and I'm not gonna
let you put yourself in danger.
Get in the car. We're going.
I'm not going anywhere.
Mike, I--believe it or not,
I am not an idiot.
I don't need to be rescued
from whatever trouble it is
you think I'm getting myself into.
You don't know this guy like I do.
I know the look in somebody's
eyes when they're hurting,
and I'm not leaving until
I know that Paul's okay.
So you're going back in there.
Yeah. Support me or not.
That's what I'm doing.
Ugh!
I heard an oven timer go off.
Let's take a look.
No!
Aah! Not yet!
Secret's all in the cooling,
and in fact, it'll probably
cool faster on the windowsill.
Hi. We're collecting for juvenile--
out of my way!
Hot cake!
Okay, but while we are waiting,
there's just one thing
I have to say.
Hey. This is not about a cake.
This is about trust.
It is a sad day when a husband
forces a wife to bake for him
just to prove she's not a liar.
Do you have any idea
how offensive that is?
Cake's ready.
Ahh. There. One perfect
pineapple upside down cake.
If only trust were so easy to make.
You look surprised.
I am.
After the way I talked to you,
I was kind of expecting
the firing squad.
I thought about it,
but I decided to go
for the romantic dinner.
Figured, less cleanup.
Honey, I... I understand
how you feel about Paul.
I know you're just
trying to protect me.
And you're just being you--
the woman that makes me
pull over to the side
of the road in a rainstorm
to pick up a sick raccoon.
It my defense,
I did think it was a cat.
The point is...
I can't stay mad at you
for being the kind,
compassionate woman you are.
Especially since it's been six weeks
since we've had sex.
That, too.
You sure you're okay
watching the girls all weekend?
Hey, can't miss your old
modeling friend's funeral.
Yeah. We were really close.
Well, you get to see
some old friends,
maybe even reconnect with a few.
Maybe.
Look, I know it's been hard
for you to not see Bree,
but it has meant a lot to me.
Nice coat. Is it new?
Yeah. I just bought it this week.
So then this long red hair
must have got on it pretty recently.
It's not what you think.
I... took Juanita
to a kid's birthday party,
and I hugged a clown.
You hugged a clown?
His monkey died.
He was very emotional.
So you're off to a funeral, huh?
What are you doing?
Don't- don't open that!
I packed it very carefully!
I can see that.
One, two, three bikinis.
Is your friend being buried at sea?
Stop it. I'm gonna be late.
Late for what?
Weekend getaway with Bree?
Damn it, Gaby.
I forbade you to see her.
Well, that was your first mistake.
What did you expect?
I expected you to choose me!
You know, ever since
we moved to this street,
and--and you got so tight
with those women,
I always feel like you put them first.
You know that's not true.
Prove it.
Choose.
Who do you want in your life--
me or Bree?
Don't do this.
I am doing it, Gaby.
Choose.
Yes, the residents of Wisteria Lane
are nothing if not loyal,
but there are times
when that loyalty
is put to the test...
By the desire to help
a stricken friend...
By the need to protect
a long-buried secret.
By the movement
of two lives in opposite directions.
And sometimes just as one
test of loyalty ends...
another begins.
Gaby, I thought we said
we'd meet at the spa.
Little change of plans.
Carlos knows.
About us?
Yeah.
Can I stay with you for a while?
Of course.
Thank you.
Girls, come on. Go on in.
