I just got fired.
And what about me?
What about you?
What about me?
Okay. That's it.
I'm going over there right fucking now,
before they leave.
Erlich, I'm gonna use your car.
Jared, you call Ron LaFlamme, tell him to meet me there.
Fuck these assholes!
Wait. Richard, I'm coming with you.
Here. Jared, clear this.
Get all the smoke out of it.
Otherwise, it damages the device.
Don't be a pussy.
How could they do this?
How could they fire me from my own company?
Just stay calm. We're gonna fight this.
Jesus, Richard, slow down.
Stop, stop, stop!
Did I just hit a deer?
No, goddamn it!
Fucking Stanford Robotics.
Shit. Is this gonna make us late?
They killed the Bam-bot.
Fuck your Bam-bot!
You little Stanford cunts fucked up my grille!
Fucking piece of shit! Wait.
You little cunt!
Fuck!
This one's for your mama.
Erlich, stop. Come on. Erlich, we've got to get to Raviga.
Hey, no, no.
Thanks for coming, Ron.
I'd bail on spin class any day for you, Richie.
Richard. Richard.
I kept calling, you weren't answering.
Talk to the hand, Monica.
Richard, can you stop? I can explain, okay?
It's pretty self-explanatory, Monica. You voted to fire me.
What the fuck?
I mean, there is no way I'm letting you push me out of this.
Our intention is not to push you out.
We wish rather to transition you
to a more appropriate role within the company.
A new CEO will be brought in to manage day-to-day operations
while you assume the role of Chief Technology Officer.
Congratulations.
- CTO? - Yes.
You want me to be an employee at my own company?
You would still be in charge of the engineering,
and you'd continue vesting your shares, and keep your board seat.
The same seat I had an hour ago when you voted to fire me as CEO?
- That came in handy. - Richard, please.
I realize this may be bittersweet, but earlier this evening
Raviga decided to officially fund Pied Piper Series A Round
at $5 million at a $50 million valuation.
Essentially, you have created
a company that is too valuable for you to run.
You should feel good about that.
Are you kidding me? I made the company, okay?
I'm the one who came up with the name "Pied Piper."
Yeah.
Ron, can I have a word please?
They can't really do this, can they?
I think they just did.
You remember that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman,
and I said, "Hey, Richie, this is a shit deal,"
but you took it anyway
because you wanted to do something crazy for once in your life?
Yes, I remember.
Well, you basically just loaded a gun and handed it to Hanneman,
and Hanneman sold that gun to Raviga,
and then Raviga just fucking pistol-whipped you.
But hey, at least they're letting you keep your shares
and your board seat.
You lose a little blood with the dilution
for the new CEO, but I've seen worse.
Like that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman.
If we give Richard a little bit of space,
he'll be able to wrap his head around this,
and a smooth transition to a new CEO will be possible.
To wit, I served as the CEO of Aviat--
Mr. Bachman.
In the version of Pied Piper in which I am invested,
you will not be CEO. Not now. Not ever.
Well, you, madam, are a shrew of the first order.
Okay. I'm not gonna let you do this.
I'm gonna fight it.
I understand you're upset.
As you can see, this is a very emotional time for me as well,
but we have some very strong candidates
coming in for the CEO position,
and we would so appreciate your input.
My input?
You want me to help you pick my new replacement?
I'd rather quit.
And I don't care how much money I lose,
because I am gonna get it all back
when I sue the living shit out of you!
Okay. All right. All right.
Ron, let's go.
Sorry, I'm forced to inform you
that I can no longer provide you with legal counsel.
What are you talking about? You're my attorney.
No. Technically, I'm Pied Piper's corporate counsel,
and you just declared your intention to walk.
So, in effect, you kind of just threatened to sue me,
and I don't take kindly to threats, Mr. Hendricks.
"Mr. Hendricks"?
What happened to "Richie"?
Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to discuss him
with you either, Mr. Hendricks.
Richard, if I didn't vote to remove you,
then Laurie would've adjourned the meeting,
replaced my seat on the board with someone else at Raviga,
and then they would've voted to remove you.
At least this way, I'm still in the game.
No. You mean, at least this way, you kept your job.
At least the actual Judas had the courtesy to kill himself
after betraying his leader, Jesus Christ.
He's the CEO of the world. Ever heard of him?
Yeah. Got it. Went to Catholic school.
Really? How long?
Look, I'm still on the board of this company.
I'll be in all of the meetings.
Maybe I can be helpful at some point.
You wanna be helpful, Monica?
Convince Laurie to keep me on as CEO.
Look, I know I made some mistakes. I wasn't perfect,
but I'll get better. I'll even go to one of those CEO coaches,
like that guy at fucking Twitter.
Richard, it's done.
Laurie already found a new CEO.
What? Already?
You said that you didn't want to be part of the interview process,
so they picked someone this morning.
Jack Barker. He's an incredibly skilled, top-notch CEO.
I don't care who he is, okay? None of us do.
"Action" Jack Barker?
Seriously? They picked that gray-haired fossil over me?
You said you turned the job down.
I said it was mutual.
What? That's accurate.
He ran Entercross Systems.
They IPO'ed in 1998 for more than a billion dollars.
Yeah, 20 fucking years ago.
Tech 1.0. What has he done lately?
After that, he ran Turnwire for four years
until it was acquired by Microsoft for $2 billion.
Holy shit. This guy's a hitter.
He was, in the oughts. What's he done in the 20-teens?
Looks like he started a foundation
in his mother's name to cure cancer.
Yeah, how's that going?
Yeah. I bet his mother's dead.
Yeah, that's probably why he started the foundation.
Richard, Laurie's meeting with him tomorrow.
You should come in and talk with him.
No fucking way.
Think this through. I mean, you have to know
that you can't start another compression company.
No VC will fund that out of fear of being sued,
and unless you have some totally different,
game-changing idea lying around--
So you're saying that I'm fucked if I leave?
No, I'm saying that--
Okay. Well, then I guess I'm fucked,
because I'm out.
And when I leave, Jared's out, Dinesh is out, Gilfoyle is out.
Everybody's out.
So good luck with the company there, Monica.
It'll just be you, Laurie Bream,
and some fucking asshole who can't even cure cancer.
He's right.
Where Richard goes, I go.
Monica, excuse how high I am,
but are the uniforms in
Catholic schools as low-cut as they are online?
Fuck off.
Did you tell Richard you were out?
No. Did you?
No.
Are we out?
Did Gavin tell you what this is about?
We haven't spoken in some time.
Thank you all for coming on such short notice.
I have a difficult announcement to make.
We, in the tech business, often refer to failure as a good thing.
Failure is growth.
Failure is learning.
But sometimes failure is just failure.
I think...
I'm sorry.
I didn't think it would be this hard.
But goodbyes are always hard,
especially when I am the one saying goodbye.
Today, effective immediately,
I, Gavin Belson, founder and CEO of Hooli,
am forced to officially say goodbye to the entire Nucleus division.
All Nucleus personnel will be given proper notice and terminated.
But make no mistake.
Though they're the ones leaving,
it is I who must remain
and bear the heavy burden of their failure.
It is my fault.
I trusted them to get the job done.
But that is the price of leadership.
Thank you.
That was the gutsiest thing I've ever seen.
Amazing.
So, wait, does that mean...
Uh... Denpok?
Can I have your Big Gulp?
I know we keep saying this,
but even though Richard is a great guy...
And a brilliant coder.
He's wonderful.
Nevertheless, he is lacking in certain...
managerial capacities.
- Totally fair. - It's fair, right?
He's still a great coder.
And an amazing human being.
- Okay, look. - Such...
We have a lot of shit we want to say about him.
Do we have to keep prefacing it with all this nice-guy stuff?
I mean, if so, we're gonna be here all night.
Yeah, we kind of do, though,
just to offset the shittiness of all the shitty stuff.
What if we use like a dictionary patch?
To compress all the nice-guy stuff.
Like an acronym.
Exactly.
"Richard is great, but you know"...
R-I-g-b-y.
Rigby.
Rigby is all the nice-guy stuff.
Okay. Rigby.
But he just assumed we were gonna leave with him,
which is kind of total bullshit, right?
That's really arrogant.
Rigby. We gave up our own apps...
so that we could bust our asses for him.
Why the fuck should we give up our Pied Piper shares
right when we get funded
because he's too much of a prima donna
to let someone experienced come in
and run the company the way its supposed to be run.
Rigby. Rigby.
Now I'm actually getting kind of fucking angry!
I mean, we put in so much work for no pay,
and now he thinks he's gonna walk out on us?
I mean, seriously, fuck that guy.
Fuck him. Rigby.
What are we gonna do?
Rigby. Rigby.
Richard, I have something that might cheer you up.
What is this?
Go on, Gloomy Gus, open it.
Okay.
So this is a box of files with companies' information on it?
No. These are all companies
that I took the liberty of reaching out to
that are actually offering you the job of CTO.
Really?
Some of these companies are pretty good.
Flutterbeam's like... really good.
Of course it is. They all are.
You're the belle of the ball,
and these are all your swains,
hoping for a glimpse of ankle.
The nest wherein the asp doth coil.
Where's Richard? Is he coming?
Nope.
Congratulations, you've successfully broken a good man.
Is that Barker?
Uh... yeah.
What are you gonna do?
I just spent the last 16 hours cherry-picking Friars Roasts
for the premium old-man jokes.
Essentially, I'm going to beat him to death
with his own titanium hips.
Not just for me, but for Richard.
Jack Barker, aka Action Jack.
We meet at last.
Erlich Bachman.
Mr. Bachman.
Pleasure to finally meet you.
I'm a big fan.
Oh, really? Of what? Metamucil?
Polio? The phonograph?
A nice piece of fish?
Segregated water fountains?
Senior citizen discounts at Perkins Family restaurants?
Erectile dysfunction because of corroded penile arteries?
Deviled eggs as an entree?
Liking Ike?
No.
None of those, Mr. Bachman.
I am a fan of yours.
Have been ever since you were at the helm of Aviato.
You know Aviato?
Yes. Aviato.
My Aviato?
Is there any other Aviato?
Well, legally, there cannot be.
Mr. Barker, pleasure to meet you.
- Is that a poppy seed muffin? - Yes, sir.
Well, Poppy wants one 'cause Mommy already got hers.
Hooli stock jumped seven percent today
on this news that Gavin Belson is writing down
the entire Nucleus project.
What's happening here?
It was a courageous move.
He's a straight shooter,
and obviously Wall Street is responding to that.
So, what else do you think--
So, by our account,
just under 50 percent of Hooli employment agreements
include a non-compete clause.
The same clause that caused us
to lose the Pied Piper lawsuit in arbitration
and are thus legally invalid,
calling into question some of our IP ownership.
Shit. I was afraid of that.
But hypothetically, this also presents an opportunity.
Any of those people could be dismissed with no severance.
Any unvested stock would return to the company option pool.
So, in other words, we have the right
to terminate any of those people
with no repercussions whatsoever,
and we'd actually make money?
Correct.
You know, our annual individual performance reviews
showed a 20 percent incidence of sub-standard work.
So essentially, one out of every five Hooli team members
deserve to be fired.
Oh, I'm sorry. What?
So, are you nervous?
No, actually. I feel pretty good.
Flutterbeam was the best company we looked at.
Their tech is great. Their offer is amazing.
Actually, I'm kind of pumped.
Well, your pumpedness makes me pumped.
You just got-- okay.
- I'll do it. - Yeah.
All right. Well, Jared...
we gotta one day figure out
what we're gonna do for you for a job.
Richard, you'll go. You'll establish yourself,
and when the time is right, you'll send for me.
Richard, you have to talk to this man.
Who, Barker? Pass.
This guy is real, okay, Richard?
With his managerial skills
and your talent as an engineer,
we could be talking about the D-word here.
- Dick? - No. Decacorn.
A company that's valued over $10 billion
before its initial public offering. All right?
He's still at Raviga for another hour.
Please go talk to him.
Sorry, I can't do that.
I'm already set up at Flutterbeam.
Whose CEO, unprompted, said,
"A brain like Richard's comes along once in a generation."
Sorry. I'm just proud.
Richard, I'm not asking you to spoon with the guy
or even fork him.
- What I'm asking for-- - What is that?
Forking is when you use your dick and your two legs
to stab him in the lower torso.
I'm asking for you to take 10 minutes and talk to him
before you throw everything that we built away.
And yes, I did say "we."
I mean, if you want to stop by Raviga,
it's on the way to Flutterbeam.
I mean, I threw some Tyson-level haymakers at this guy.
Richard, he didn't flinch.
He floats like a butterfly.
Hey, Richard.
What's going on?
- We've been talking. - Okay.
Guys, this isn't really a great time. Richard.
We wanna tell you something. Right?
Yeah, it's something important.
Maybe later. So, Richard?
Guys, come on.
We know you're leaving...
- Yep. Well aware. - ...but...
We're not. Yeah. ...we're gonna stay at Pied Piper.
Really?
Why are you laughing?
I'm sorry. Wow.
Well, it's just that you really think
that you're gonna be able to scale the platform without me?
Goddamn it!
- Yeah. - You don't think we can?
Well, I know you can't.
That's a bold statement.
- Richard. - We have massive tech debt.
You really think that you can scale and deploy my library
without any input from me?
Are you serious here?
- Yes, we do. - Yeah.
Then I guess you are truly delusional.
Well, I think you're an arrogant prick.
I'm the arrogant prick.
Okay. This is coming from two people
who think they know everything about code they didn't even write.
We wrote a lot of the code.
- You wrote some of it. - You know what? We're gonna stay,
and we're gonna build Pied Piper just to prove you wrong.
Okay. Thank you for the solidarity by the way,
and sticking with your friend.
You know what, Erlich? You can tell Barker to go fuck himself,
so I can go to Flutterbeam
and then watch these two assholes crash and burn
trying to build out Pied Piper by themselves.
This'll be great.
Great timing, guys. Thank you so much.
Premium stuff, Dinesh.
Richard. Richard?
Well, we are now living in a post-Rigby world.
Man, this place is amazing.
Yeah. We raised a shit ton of money.
We're growing fast as balls.
But we're not exactly super psyched
with the quality of our engineering.
Well, it's a good thing I'm here then, right?
All joking aside, I actually have a few thoughts
on your video platform if you--
We're pretty happy with the basic platform.
We want to hand you something way cooler.
It's kind of like a secret project.
I got to warn you, though. It's pretty rad.
Sit right here.
All right. Oh. Hello.
This is the present.
You ready to go to the future?
Sure.
Three, two, one.
Bam!
Oh. I-- I have a mustache.
Fuck yeah, you do.
And check this out.
Turn your head. See that?
Compositing perfect 3-D holographic mustaches
using depth-sensing cameras in a live video chat.
- And no one's doing it. - Nobody.
Sorry. This is the-- this is the rad thing?
Look, Richard, we agree, okay?
We're not there yet.
We're using a crappy plug-in, so the latency is bad.
You turn too fast, that mustache is on your ear.
But with your help, we think we can cut our 'stache lag
to just... 20 milliseconds motion-to-photon
in... nine months?
Just in time for Movember.
So, which one do you want on your employee badge?
- Tom Selleck? - Aloha.
Ooh, Fu Manchu.
- John Waters. - Not bad.
Alex Trebek. Hitler.
Probably not Hitler. Skip him. Oh yeah.
- Bam. Sam Elliot. - Howdy.
Sure.
Okay, so we've got to hop on a call with biz dev...
Okay. ...but feel free to keep on 'staching. Okay?
- There you go. - All right.
Hey, if you want to have
your attorney look over the employment agreement
and the stock option grant, it's cool by us, all right?
Just sign it. You're in.
We'll see you Monday, man. We're pumped.
Okay. Well, your pumpedness makes me pumped.
Pete Monahan, please. It's Richard Hendricks.
I just need him to go over a contract for me.
What?
Are you an attorney here to see a client?
No, actually, I'm a client here to see my attorney.
Okay. Follow me.
It began as a innocent celebration of our arbitration victory.
I ordered a kombucha, which I did not realize contained alcohol.
It was described to me as a healthy, organic tea.
Next thing I knew, I was 70 miles away,
wrapped naked in a blanket,
shaking off a meth high,
and facing charges for attacking a police horse with a shovel.
Oh. Holy shit.
From a legal standpoint, it was a clear violation of my parole,
and I must now serve my entire sentence...
Okay.
...and any additional time stemming from the new charges,
which continue to accrue.
But I'm owning my mistakes.
I am staying positive.
Enough about me.
Let's take a look at that contract.
Okay.
I would red-line it, but...
I'm not allowed to have a pencil.
This makes less sense the more I look at it.
Okay. What's this number over here?
I don't know.
I didn't handle the compression library.
Neither did I.
You're telling me Richard did this all on his own?
Shit. I thought you did it.
Now I respect you even less.
We each know 90 percent of the platform...
but it's the same 90 percent.
Maybe that arrogant prick was right.
We can't scale it without him.
We are so fucked.
Wait.
- Yeah? - I got it.
We quit out of solidarity with Richard.
That's interesting.
So even though he said all that horrible shit to us,
we take the high road
and we get his back.
Maybe he'll even hire us at his new company.
Flutterbeam.
- Mustaches? - Yes.
Doesn't necessarily have to stop at people.
They can put mustaches on their pets, too.
It's actually pretty fun.
So, soon you'll be putting mustaches on cats and dogs and...
- snakes. - Snakes, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's a little tricky because they don't have a philtrum,
so finding an anchor point for that mustache is actually...
gonna be quite of a technological challenge.
- It's exciting stuff. It really is. - Richard.
Richard.
Let me ask you something.
Why are you leaving Pied Piper?
They pushed me out.
I thought they offered you another position.
Yeah, CTO. It's a demotion.
Well, wouldn't you be CTO at Flutterbeam?
Yes, but at least this way, I don't have to eat shit.
Richard, let me tell you something I learned here on the inside.
Swallow your pride,
or soon you'll be eating something far worse than shit.
Believe me.
Don't you think you should at least meet this Barker fellow?
So where are we?
Seventeen hundred people slated for exiting.
Their negated options total 780,000 shares.
That money can be allocated anyway you see fit.
Employee bonuses, renovations to the day-care center.
What have you. What should we prioritize?
Sorry, I don't understand.
It's all in the document.
You take that severance package,
and you leave Hooli immediately.
But the most important aspect
is the non-disclosure, non-disparagement clause,
in which you agree not to say anything negative in the press,
in public, or in private
about Hooli or Gavin Belson.
Okay, I won't.
You will not discuss anything you did at Hooli
at all, in perpetuity,
throughout the universe.
I didn't really do anything at Hooli, so...
Good. You're getting the hang of it already.
So, can I keep my Hooli ID, though,
so I can still come and hang out with my friends on the roof?
You cannot.
Officially, you will no longer have any friends here.
Shoot.
I have to think about this then.
This settlement offer is quite generous.
I know, I know. I mean, $2 million is a lot of money.
Two? No. It's...
It's $20 million.
Twenty?
So they fired me before they hired you,
so it's not your fault. I just--
I feel like this... can't really work.
- Do you understand? - I do, Richard.
It's like...
can I really be expected to do my best work
when I am constantly feeling undervalued
at the company that I started?
Does that make sense?
It does, Richard. Absolutely.
I hear each and every one of your concerns loud and clear,
and I appreciate your position.
So, I guess we just won't do it.
Come on, I'll walk you out.
Wait. What?
Sorry. You what? Jack?
Sorry, I don't understand.
You're not gonna take the job?
Not if you're not.
Without you handling the tech,
I don't see how this company works.
I mean, yeah, I agree.
Richard, it's hard enough running a business
when everyone is on the same page.
And clearly, we are not.
- Well... yeah. - No, no, it's fine,
and I appreciate you being so honest with me.
I mean, better we find out now, right?
Anyway, I hope we each find a good fit somewhere.
Thanks for coming up.
You got a hell of a brain there, Richard Hendricks.
You drive safe.
Well, Richard, according to all of your test results,
you are what we in the medical field call
healthy.
In fact, you've got kind of a glow about you.
- Oh, really? - Absolutely.
You know, if it were medically possible,
I might even think that you were pregnant.
Of course, I thought my girlfriend was pregnant,
and I was sure wrong about that.
Hey, give me that ring back!
What a mess.
What a mess that was.
So, been any big changes for you,
diet or exercise?
Well, I actually got fired
as CEO of my company.
I'm working now as the CTO
under the new CEO, Jack Barker.
Wait a minute. You got a boss at your own company?
Yeah, I know that sounds bad,
but honestly, he handles all the budgeting,
all the VC funding.
He just negotiated a great new lease
on our new offices.
I don't know. I think this could be great for me.
Boy, I don't think I could have another doctor
coming in here, being my boss.
No. It'd be like, "Hey, boss,
Is it okay if I listen to his heart?
Can I do that? Oh, no? Sorry.
No, I won't. Okay.
Whatever you say!"
- Ah, funny. - It is funny. Yeah.
But listen, if it works for you, that's great.
Just one more thing.
I've gotta check your testicles.
Oh my God. Okay.
What, for like a hernia or something?
No. I just wanna make sure they're still there.
This is going to be our office?
All of this?
Yeah, Jack said we have the whole floor.
Wow, look at that kitchen. This is great.
Richard, is that our new logo?
I like it. It's clean and elegant,
but not without some danger.
Gentlemen, welcome.
I moved away from the flute-playing guy.
I don't know if you guys realized it,
but that was a little phallic.
I didn't want to waste your time with it,
so I just pulled the trigger.
Mari Sheibley did this.
Mari Sheibley.
That must've set you back a bit.
No. She's a friend.
Yeah. I know her... as well.
Casually.
So, why don't I show you guys your new home?
Hopefully, it lives up to your standards.
Yeah, compared to the shit shack we're used to,
anything's an improvement.
An insult born of respect.
I'll worry when we start complimenting each other.
Fucking dick.
I assume you saw Hiroki putting in the water feature.
Good feng shui. Gotta have that.
This is the engineering area.
We're gonna work here?
That is a separate, professionally-catered
micro-kitchen back there.
I want you hungry here, never here.
This is all great, but can we really afford all this?
Hey, step into my office, Richard.
- Here. - Okay.
I wanna show you something.
This is way better than Erlich's shithole.
"The Conjoined Triangles of Success"?
I invented that,
and now it's taught at business schools.
You see what's on the bottom here?
The foundation of the whole thing.
- Growth? - Growth.
The more brilliant people we can get working here,
then the faster we can get
whatever is in your head out into the world.
Let me tell you a story.
In 1999,
Google was a little startup, just like we are.
And when they started bringing in chefs and masseuses,
we thought, "They're nuts!"
But they were attracting the best possible people,
and they were able to create the best product,
and now they're worth over $400 billion.
And do you know the name of that company?
Google, right? You said it at the beginning of the story.
You're right. I did that wrong.
And the whole point is
that all of this is a sound investment
as long as we are able to get the best people
and make the best possible product.
All right. Winner gets the big monitor.
I understand how this works.
Ready?
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Suck it.
I should've known you'd throw rock.
That's all you know in Pakistan. It's in your blood.
Don't you guys call it "Rock, Rock, Rock"?
That's funny. You should type up all your racist jokes
on your tiny monitor.
Is that monitor not big enough?
You need a bigger monitor?
You just put it on the list over there,
and our purchasing guy will hook you up.
- Seriously? - Absolutely.
Hey, Jared, how about you? You need any new gear for the office?
No, I'm BYOC.
Let me know if you need anything.
Richard, do you think it'd be okay if I took this box?
I'm moving out of Noah's guest house after work.
And you want to sleep in that box?
No.
I haven't slept in a box in years. Stop.
Now that Pied Piper's funded,
I have enough money to move back into my condo.
Oh. Congratulations.
I thought you sold it.
No, I've been AirBNB'ing it out
to cover the mortgage.
But it'll be good to get home.
I've been missing my tub a lot,
and Noah's been using a lot of hate speech with me lately,
so moving will be a good thing.
All right, guys, think I'm gonna take off
unless you need me to stick around, help you transition.
I-- By doing what?
I could introduce you to some of the people that work here.
I made some major inroads with Hiroki.
No. Why would we want that?
Fair-- yeah, fair point.
So, welcome to your new home.
Enjoy it, guys. I gave you this.
Sorry. Sorry.
How was everyone's morning?
Let me tell you about mine.
I started my day, as I always do,
by typing my own name into Hooli-Search.
I enjoy the ritual, which is designed to center me.
But lately, it's been doing the opposite.
Whose work station is this?
Observe.
These are all remnants of a time before I wrote Nucleus down.
Why are we allowing our own technology
to dredge up our painful past?
Why is it that when I type my own name
into my own company search engine,
the fucking Internet rains shit-bolts down on me?
I want this to stop!
These articles are part of the public record.
Your point?
Are you suggesting that we alter
the fundamental neutrality of the Hooli-Search algorithm?
That's a clear violation of the public trust.
Yelp is threatening to sue Google for this very thing.
I can't, in good conscience,
order Hooli-Search engineers to do that.
I never suggested anything of the sort.
No Hooli-Search engineer
will ever be asked to alter the neutrality of the algorithm.
And so, Gavin doesn't want to see
any more negative mentions of Nucleus on Hooli-Search.
So... we're gonna alter the search algorithm?
Of course not. That would be unethical.
What are we supposed to do?
Promote other websites to outrank the bad Nucleus news?
Do you have any idea how big a fucking job that is?
Don't you swear at me.
We don't work here anymore.
For 10 more days you do!
Unless you'd all like to quit and walk away
from your entire severance packages!
Amazing.
Jared. Whoa.
What's up?
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.
You-- you were supposed to be out on Tuesday.
Oh, I was, but plans have changed.
See...
I can't really afford to move or pay rent,
so I'm gonna have to stay a little while.
Okay, look...
I appreciate your situation,
but... you're breaking the terms of our contract.
Listen, I don't want to be a dick,
it's just I can't afford to live around here.
'cause the rent is so high,
because of the tech companies, right?
And you bought this place with the money you made
working at the tech companies,
so... it kind of all evens out, right?
That-- that makes no sense.
I know. Right?
Okay, look, I can give you a few days,
two weeks tops,
but if you're not out by then,
I'm gonna have to take legal action.
This bums me out, man.
I thought you were like the one cool tech guy.
Me?
Are you sure?
Not anymore.
Well...
Well, the occupant of a residence in California
has almost unlimited rights.
I have to get his permission to enter my property.
I can't turn off the power or the gas,
and I have to hire a lawyer
to start a legal eviction. That won't be cheap.
Jeez, man. I'm sorry. That sucks.
So, where did you sleep last night?
I did not. How was your sleep?
It was-- it was good, yeah.
I mean, I slept like a stone.
It's odd not having to do everything ourselves, isn't it?
Yeah, I'm-- I'm kinda loving it.
Hey, you ready to go to work?
Chef Amy asked us what we wanted for breakfast,
and I said, "surprise us."
Could be anything. Let's go!
When was the last time you saw those two
- go anywhere before noon? - Indeed.
Well, let's go get some gluten-free waffles.
Oh. Sorry about the surprise.
- I don't care. - I asked Chef Amy to tell me.
I have too many dietary restrictions
to leave breakfast to chance.
- Makes sense. - Ah, two of my incubees
off to eat the world.
Be well, work hard, and know one another.
Okay.
I recently helped them install a new CEO at Pied Piper.
I needed to take a more hands-off approach,
focus on the future-- incubees, like yourself,
with great ideas, like cataloging malware.
Sexy. Uh, would you care for another coconut water?
They are the most expensive unpasteurized variety,
if that's any concern.
Actually, my concern is the room.
It's kind of a dump.
Oh, sure, now.
But with a new coat of paint,
you'll hardly recognize the place when you move in next month.
Actually...
shit's pivoted.
I need a place next week.
Next week? Oh, shit has pivoted.
Well, I'll talk to the current tenant.
Let him know that the time has... come.
Mother... fuck.
Yeah, put him on a slow boat to China, so to speak.
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.
I'll ask Chef Amy to make you something else.
No, no, no, I want waffles.
I just wanted them to be a surprise, Jared.
I wanted surprise waffles.
Who are these people?
Uh, I don't know.
Did Jack hire engineers already?
These people are not in the engineering gene pool.
That's right, fellas.
These are our new sales people.
They're the best in the business.
Sales? Uh, Jack?
Jack?
Shouldn't we hire engineers to build the platform
before we get people to sell it?
No.
God, no!
The system, Richard.
Sales and engineering are the two pillars
of the Conjoined Triangles of Success.
Yeah. Engineering and sales must work together
to decide what to build.
Who knows better what the customers' need
than the people who actually deal with
the customers every single day?
We're all gonna meet at 1:00, Richard.
You're gonna love these guys. They're the best.
So, while the Hooli lawsuit
did hamper our ability to get funding,
it did not slow down the engineering.
Yes, question?
Yeah, Keith, Northeast Regional.
So, you don't foresee any technical debt issues
slowing our ability to scale?
Actually, no, none whatsoever.
We've identified all our underlying issues,
and we have a plan in place for rapid growth.
Uh, yes?
Don, Global Accounts and Systems Integration.
What kind of growth are you projecting here?
Well, this may sound a little bit grandiose,
but it's not unrealistic
to think that we have the potential
for worldwide penetration
on the scale of, say, Google or Facebook.
This is really great, Richard. Just keep going.
Sure. Yeah.
Well, in regards to the launch,
we are hoping to go wide,
get it into the hands of as many people as possible.
Jan, Director, Inside Sales.
They call me "Jan the Man."
When you say "people," You mean "companies," Right?
Yeah, we're business-facing.
Okay, just wanted to clarify.
Actually, no. No, sorry, Jan the Man.
By "people," I do mean "people."
Humans. Consumers.
Keith, Northeast Regional, again.
Jack told us
we would be selling directly to businesses.
- He did? - Doug. I'm shadowing Keith.
- Yes, he did. - Definitely. I was there.
Don, again.
Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding,
because the plan has always been...
entirely based on the freemium model, like Dropbox?
You know, you give the platform away free to consumers,
and then once you have a big enough user base,
then you sell premium services to businesses.
If we're giving it away now
and waiting until later to sell it,
what are we doing here now?
I don't know. I don't know.
We could maybe ask Jack...
when he gets back from wherever...
Sorry, one second. Just-- just one moment.
Jack. Sorry, Jack.
Sorry. Excuse me, Jack.
Are you leaving?
Oh, I have this charity wine thing.
Sorry, I committed to it months ago,
but you are killing it in there, Richard.
Well, actually no.
Sorry. They just said
that you told them that we would be business-facing?
Ah, they filled you in. That's good.
I was under the impression that we would be consumer first.
My guys are pretty set on that.
Richard, I read your deck,
and you projected it'll be four years until we get to revenue?
Uh, yeah.
You know we're in a bubble right now, right?
Or maybe you don't know. You weren't around for the last bubble.
You were probably in diapers.
I was 11. Well, I wasn't in diapers.
I don't-- I wasn't either.
I was there.
And in March of 2000, do you know when a four-year plan ended?
April of 2000.
We gotta move, now.
We can't put all of our eggs
in the pot-of-gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow basket.
So, the-- the pot of gold is in the basket?
Richard, these are the best salespeople in the world,
and when they tell me that business-facing is the play,
I gotta listen to that, okay?
- That's fair, but it's-- - I'm just asking you to talk to your guys
about modifying your platform for enterprise.
I mean, just-- just see how it feels, okay?
And no matter what happens,
I promise you this:
I will never compromise the product.
Okay. Okay.
Fine, I will talk to my guys,
but they're not gonna be happy about it.
No, of course not. They're engineers.
I'll see you later.
I realize this is a Japanese tradition and that you are Chinese.
I'm not racist.
Yes, Japanese people racist.
- They are horrible. - No. No, no.
Jian-Yang, in every relationship,
there are ebbs and flows.
- Ebbs? - Yes.
And although we have flowed,
our relationship now
has come to a permanent ebbing.
Flow.
No. No.
We have come to a permanent ebb.
Do you understand?
So, you want me to leave the house?
Yes. Yes. Very much so.
And so, I thank you...
for our today.
Now you bow.
Bow.
All the way to the waist.
N-no.
- Okay. - Thank you, Elrich.
Goodbye, little one.
I'm gonna miss you.
Can't say it wasn't fun, Jian-Yang...
you little Cantonese bastard.
- Hey, you like this? - What are you doing?
Hi, my name's Erlich Bachman.
I'm a lying fuck!
Who-- who are you yelling at?
We're the only two people in the fucking house!
Erlich a liar!
You're not gonna get me to change my opinion about myself.
- Liar! - Take that outta there!
I don't know, Richard. I don't think it's that big a deal.
Really, you don't? You're okay with being business first?
Granted, it's not what we would do if we were in charge,
but Jack seems to know what he's doing.
This is fucking amazing.
I feel like I'm in "Minority Report."
And in reality, you're just a minority.
Richard, relax. We're still building the neural net.
We still get to do all the cool stuff, right?
Yeah, of course.
We're not scrapping any peer-to-peer delivery?
No, no, definitely not.
So, we're still doing the same stuff, just in a different order.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well, the eviction process is officially underway,
but my attorney says it may take up to a year.
- Where are you gonna stay? - Well, I always have my trick.
All right, I'll bite. What's your trick?
I simply imagine that my skeleton is me,
and my body is my house,
and that way, I'm always home.
Okay. Well...
we are now business-facing. I don't know if you heard.
That means we have to rewrite our entire deck.
I just hope it doesn't put us way the fuck behind.
Behind who? EndFrame sucks
and Nucleus shit the bed, remember?
Yeah, yeah. You're right, you're right.
This is endless.
If we worked this hard on Nucleus in the first place,
we probably wouldn't be scrubbing it right now.
- Dude, are you done? - Yup.
How'd you script digest all those strings so fast?
I don't know. It's just a predictive loop.
Actually, it's sort of like a context tree.
Holy shit.
What's up?
Hey, Jared, why don't we knock off for tonight?
Just pick this back up tomorrow morning?
Agreed.
I'm going on close to 40 hours without good sleep,
and the edges of things are starting to get a little dancey.
What?
Erlich, thank you again for allowing me to occupy
a corner of your cozy garage.
It is my hearth and my home.
What the fuck?
Jian-Yang, Jesus Christ,
don't sneak up on people like that, you devious little bastard,
especially if they're cleaning glassware.
You kick me out, but you let him stay.
He's not even an incubee.
No, he's not, and he's not staying in the house.
He's in the garage, like a sad bag of potting soil.
Have some compassion.
I mean, the guy rented his place
to some fuckhead tenant who won't leave.
Jared is fucked, Jian-Yang.
He can go to the police.
It's useless. California law gives landlords literally no recourse.
So, he can go to court.
Of course, he's going to go to court, you four-eyed turd.
But in America, the legal system doesn't work very well,
so it will take at least a year
for the proceedings to even begin.
Do you understand that?
Yes. I stay here for one year.
I pay no rent.
You have no recourse.
That's not always the case.
I mean, sometimes court systems can move faster,
- especially if you have money for-- - I'm going to smoke in my room.
- Oh. Mother fuck. - Special occasion.
If we stack that same loop on top of the bit-level encoder
that we took from Hendricks,
and then we tethered it to the routine we were trying to use--
That would be a huge jump in speed.
This is mega.
This is what Hendricks did at Tech Crunch Disrupt.
I think we just cracked middle-out.
We should probably tell Gavin, right?
Why? He fired us.
You know how much we could get paid
if we took this somewhere else?
Fuck off.
Okay, let me get this straight.
First you talked me into going business-facing,
and now you want to eliminate
the entire neural net from the platform?
Jan, Director, Inside Sales. They call me "Jan the Man."
Yes, we know, "Jan the Man."
Listen, we have to do neural net for deep learning.
Look, once we get enough data flowing through the system,
it will be able to recognize long-range patterns
and actually learn.
It will be able to optimize our algorithm on its own,
increasing our already superior speed and efficiency.
Right? Pretty cool, huh?
But it won't be able to do that if we delete it.
- Do you get that? - But you just said it.
It requires a central repository of data, right?
Businesses want to protect their data.
They're huge pussies when it comes to security.
Okay, well, we're not cutting machine learning. We're not.
If we cut that, we might as well cut peer-to-peer delivery,
and all the efficiencies of the cloud.
Are those still in?
No, those have to go also.
- What? - Keith, by the way.
I know your name, okay? I know everybody's name.
Look...
we can't cut everything about this platform
that makes it revolutionary just because that's
a little harder for you guys to sell, all right?
If we want to sell out, let's just sell all the way out.
Let's just take the algorithm, jam it into a metal fucking box,
stick it in the back of a data center somewhere,
so it can't connect to anything,
and it just sits there and no one even knows it's there.
Doug, still shadowing Keith.
When you say "Metal box," You're talking
about a rack-mounted server-type appliance?
No, no, no.
I am using it as a rhetorical example of a bad idea.
That's fucking stupid.
Oh my God.
I just need to find Jack. One second.
- Where's Jack? - He had to go meet his vet.
His vet? In the middle of the day?
Okay, well, what's the vet's address?
Jack, excuse me. Do you mind telling me--
Holy shit. What is that? Oh, mother of God.
Richard, what are you doing here?
What do you mean? It's 2:30. What are you doing here?
My number one breeding mare went into heat.
Sorry, she's not much for schedules.
Oh God.
Thoroughbreds, Richard.
Natural cover only.
Now, you don't see that very often, do you?
Nope.
I had a meeting--
I had a meeting with the sales guys
and Jan the Man...
You know what? Can we talk over here?
This is just hard for me.
Look, Jack, you and I have a problem.
Okay, your salespeople are telling me
to cut everything cool about the platform
just because it's a little bit harder for them to sell.
But don't you think because they are such amazing salespeople
that it would be okay for them to sell the harder stuff?
No. It doesn't work that way.
The way you keep the best salespeople is,
you need to give 'em something easy to sell.
Otherwise, they'd just go somewhere else.
Okay, well, Pied Piper could honestly be the global standard
for file compression and storage.
Every mobile device on the face of the planet
could be able to access their data
as if they had a fiber optic cable plugged into it.
People in the desert, people in refugee camps,
people who have nothing could suddenly have access to everything.
You know, everybody in this industry,
they say they want to make this world a better place,
but we could actually do it.
We could do it and make billions of dollars.
Richard, listen--
No, you listen to me, Jack.
You promised me that you would never compromise the product.
So, do you feel like
taking some action and backing me up on this,
because me and my product
feel pretty fucking compromised right now.
Richard, I don't think you understand what the product is.
The product isn't the platform,
and the product isn't your algorithm, either.
And it's not even the software.
Do you know what Pied Piper's product is, Richard?
Is...
Is it me?
Oh God! No!
No. How could it possibly be you?
You got fired.
Pied Piper's product is its stock.
Its stock?
And whatever makes the value of that stock go up,
that is what we are going to make.
And maybe sometime in the future,
we could change the world and perform miracles,
and all of that stuff, and I hope we do.
But, like I told you before,
I'm not going to mortgage the present for that.
I need to move the needle today.
And now, if you will excuse me.
I paid $150,000
for the semen that's about to come out of that stallion,
and I would very much like to be there to see that it happens.
Oh! Hey, Richard!
- Yes? - I just got a text from Keith, Northeast Regional.
He says the guys love your idea.
What idea?
It's a big world,
but thanks to modern technology,
it's smaller than ever.
Today, business moves at the speed of light.
You can access your company's data anywhere, anytime.
But if you can get your data,
who else can get it?
Spies, thieves, criminals, and foreigners.
What if there was a way
to take all of your company's data
and back it up in a protected enclosure
completely isolated from the world at large?
Oh no.
The ultimate enterprise data storage solution.
Now that's what I'm talking about.
This is the game we're playing, team,
so let's win it!
You guys, check it out.
Chef Amy hollowed out a watermelon
and filled it with watermelon jello!
Look, that's actual rind.
The fuck is that? Is that a VCR?
Why does it say "Pied Piper" on it?
Why is everybody so happy?
Here it is.
This is your future.
One of your Pied Piper boxes
would go right here in this rack.
Okay.
Okay.
Let me show you the next location
in which we would install one of your boxes.
Richard. What the fuck are we doing here?
I don't like it any more than you do.
I told Jack we'd come check this place out
and then we'd have a discussion.
I can't believe you suggested the idea
of building a fucking appliance.
I didn't, okay?
I pitched it as an example of what not to do
and the fucking sales guys ran with it.
I didn't want to go to enterprise.
You were the ones who said it would be fine.
- No, we didn't say that. - You said it all the time.
That's not what we said. That is not...
Here it is. This is where another one
of your Pied Piper boxes would go.
Okay. Good.
Okay. Let me show you the next location
- in which we would install-- - Actually, you know what?
Sorry. No offense, but once you see one space in a rack,
you've kind of seen them all.
That's what I used to think...
until I saw them all.
Would you like to see your desks?
- Our desks? - What?
This is where we would install
a Pied Piper engineer.
Sorry. Why, exactly, would we need to be here?
Your sales representative
promised 24-hour-a-day, on-site maintenance...
at least for the first year.
So, one of us would have to be down here
for a year?
Even at night?
There's really no difference between day and night down here,
so it makes things easy.
Okay, well, we should probably get going. Now.
- Almost right now. - Yeah, right now even.
Okay. There are 16 stairwells.
Which one would you like to see first?
Just whatever's as fast as possible.
Your favorite one.
Okay.
Oh! You see these fucking mole people?
Hey, where did John go?
Oh shit. Did he go in a room?
No. Uh... probably around here.
Hey, John?
- John? - Oh. Uh... John?
- John! - Oh shit.
John!
- Where is he? John! - John!
We can't take my algorithm
and put it in a box and bury it at Maleant.
- We just can't. - I think this thing is dead.
Jack, look, I have no doubt
that your guys can sell a box
and an appliance may be a good short-term play,
but in the long term, we need to be building
- our full-time platform. - Gloria!
Could you call the fish guy and see what kind of warranty
we have one these things? I think one of them is dead.
Jack, please.
You said that when we got back from Maleant
- we would discuss this. - Okay, let's discuss it.
Take a look at the Conjoined Triangles of Success.
Now, what do those two triangles make together?
- A square? - A box. They make a box.
- You can't make that shit up. - But you literally did make it up.
Yes, I did. And now they teach it at business schools.
But I was only referring to the serendipity of the coincidence.
Look, if we build you the box,
will you promise to let us build the platform when it's done?
We'll think about then then.
Now we need to worry about now.
Build me a box... now.
How'd it go?
Not well.
All right, then.
What do you-- What do you mean? What are you doing?
Well, first, I'm changing my LinkedIn status...
to "Looking for work."
That box is artless commerce. I won't be a party to it.
So, you're just gonna quit?
Just like that? How-- How can you do that?
By saying the words "I" And "Quit"
in conjunction together-- i.e., I quit.
Well, there's actually some paperwork involved.
Hey, can I have that USB missile launcher?
I'll just fish it out of the trash later.
Gilfoyle, come on.
Give me some time to figure a way out of this,
'cause if you quit now,
you're gonna lose all your shares.
And what if Barker changes
his mind and lets us build the platform?
And the odds of that are?
Already? Recruiters move fast these days.
This is Gilfoyle. Dazzle me.
More recruiter swag?
You got an Oculus?
- Yup. - That's a hoverboard?
How many meetings are you taking?
None. That's the irony.
The more meetings I turn down, the more these recruiters send me.
- What are you doing? - Eating popcorn.
- That's my popcorn. - You have seven tubs of it.
You could be the mayor of Popcornopolis.
Don't eat the caramel. You can have the cheese or the plain.
- You're leaving me with the cheddar? - That's right. Dick.
Hey, can I borrow this? Just for a little bit?
No. Whoa, whoa, hold on.
You're wearing a gold chain?
Oh, right. Yeah, I've had it for a while.
Just kind of throw it on every now and then.
None of that is true.
- I definitely would've noticed. - Okay, listen.
I've been working hard. I'm making money for the first time.
I was like... buy myself something nice, you know?
But instead of that, you bought a chain?
You're just jealous I have a salary, quitter.
And you are too legit to quit,
eh, MC Hamas?
- Fuck off. - Later, Chain the Virgin.
Well, Gilfoyle, looks like your recruiters
are gonna have to take back their gift baskets,
because I just got off the phone with Monica
and she's getting me in to see Laurie this morning
so I can tell her what's going on.
But you're-- you're going over your CEO's head?
That is a serious breach of protocol.
I mean, if Jack finds out, he'll be furious.
Hey, when you push a man so far,
he goes out, buys a gun, and shoots everyone in a bank.
- Whoa. - No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
I'm not-- I'm not going to.
Just-- The point is,
what other option do I have, anyway?
What other option do you have, Richard?
Can I speak with you alone, please? Hmm?
Are you angry with me, Richard?
Have I done something to offend you?
No. What are you talking about?
You know, when you and the boys picked up
and went to the new offices,
and didn't invite me along...
I didn't say anything.
Yeah, because you don't work at Pied Piper.
And you haven't let me forget that
for even one moment, have you, Richard?
I-I-I-- I'm having trouble tracking this.
I don't know what you're mad about.
You publicly proclaimed, "I have to go over Barker's head
because what other option do I have?"
What other option do you have, Richard?
'Cause there is another option,
and he's standing here, looking you in the face,
and you're staring back like he don't even exist.
Just to be... as clear as I possibly can be here,
are you trying to tell me that you want to talk to Barker?
No, Richard, I don't want to talk to Barker.
I want you to want me to talk to Barker.
At this point, if it'll make you feel better,
sure, you can go talk to Barker.
See?
Was that so hard?
Actually, yes, that was painfully difficult.
Yeah, she's definitely dead.
I'm sorry for your loss. Gloria!
Gloria! Gl-- Oh!
Would you... take this daughter of Neptune
back from whence she came?
The toilet, dear. That's okay.
What can I do for you, Mr. Bachman?
Ah yes, to the matter at hand.
I spoke with Richard about the box project, and...
Well, here are some of my thoughts in no particular order.
- Why a box? - What information
- do I not already have? - I'm sorry?
I said, "What information do I not already have?"
I already have a five-year run rate
plus a full market forecast for my appliance.
I have the same for Richard's platform.
I've heard all of his engineering team's complaints.
So, before you waste time
with some freeform jazz odyssey of masturbatory bullshit,
just tell me what concrete information you have for me
that I do not already possess!
Richard.
The way I see it, you've got about two options.
One, you build yourself the box.
Two, you get Laurie Bream on the phone ASAP.
All right, I'll see you back at the house.
Okay.
Ah. Hiroki-san.
What is that one?
It is a question mark made of human hair,
harvested, apparently, from dead people in India.
It's a pun. It signifies that
at Raviga, we ask the big, hairy questions.
Right. Speaking of questions...
What should we do about Jack?
Well, I concur with your assessment
that a backup appliance for data centers seems
an uninspired application of your technology.
I will contact him and we'll have
a frank discussion about this.
Great. I really appreciate you hearing me out on this.
And it goes without saying, I was never here.
What?
You are here. Now.
What Richard means is he would prefer
if you didn't tell Jack
that he came here to talk to you about this.
Yes, because the other interpretation makes no sense.
Jack, Laurie Bream on line one.
Guys. Guys, it's happening. It's happening.
Hello.
Okay. Drop the hammer, Laurie Bream.
What are you doing? He's going to see you looking.
I can't see 'cause of these fucking monitors.
Whose fucking fault is that, okay? It's not my-- Shh!
Something's happening.
What?
What's happening? What's happening?
Oh, man. Barker's pissed.
How pissed? Scale of one to ten.
Oh my God. Seven. Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Like a nine, nine and a half.
Fuck! I'm missing everything.
I'm going to go to the kitchen.
He doesn't know. I could be hungry.
It's over. It's over.
I missed the whole fucking thing
because of these fucking monitors.
Richard? Jack would like to see you in his office.
Okay.
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
I'm gonna go ask Action Jack how Laurie's dick tastes.
D-- No. Yeah.
You wanted to see me, chief?
Sure, come on in, Richard. Grab a seat.
Sure.
So, guess who I just got off the phone with.
I have no idea. Who?
- Laurie Bream. - Laurie... Bream. From Raviga?
Exactly. She was pretty adamant
that the whole box project here at Pied Piper was...
woefully misguided.
Whoa. Strong words. Wow.
In fact, it was her opinion
that we should immediately abandon the box
in favor of the consumer platform version of Pied Piper
which I believe you and your guys were bucking for.
Oh, I don't know about "bucking,"
but yeah. Yeah, well, hey, look,
Laurie Bream is the investor.
Yeah. She is the investor.
Anyway, she wanted a comprehensive,
go-to-market strategy
for the platform version within 48 hours.
Wow. Well, what Laurie wants, Laurie gets.
So... yeah. We should probably get started on that.
No, we shouldn't, Richard.
We're not building the platform.
We're building a box.
Okay, but...
didn't Laurie say that she wanted the platform?
Yes, she said that, and then I said
that if Pied Piper was going to build a platform,
she would have to fire me.
Uh, what did she say?
She said she was not interested in doing that at this time.
And did she say anything after that?
We're building the box, Richard.
Twelve weeks from today,
we're going to present her a prototype of that box.
So, let's get it done.
Okay.
Yup.
One more thing, Richard.
If you're going to shoot the king,
you better be goddamn sure you kill him.
You understand what that means?
Yeah-ar.
Did you just say... "Yar"?
No.
Look at us.
Two rogues on the King's Highway.
Let the rats run in their maze.
We chose this. This is our destiny.
Freedom. Isn't that right, Gilfoyle?
- Did you say something? - Of course.
If it's more popcorn, tell 'em we're at capacity.
It's a guy from "Men in Black."
- Bertram Gilfoyle? - Yeah.
I'm here on behalf of Twen-X recruiting,
- I'm supposed to give you this. - Pappy Van Winkle.
Now we're talking. I'll take it.
They told me not to give it to you until after the meeting.
I respect your skills.
Let me get my jacket.
She was supposed to talk Barker out of making the box.
What the fuck happened?
- Richard. - What?
I was on the call, okay? She tried, he said no.
- Well, then she should fire him. - She can't fire him.
Why not? She fired me.
Exactly. She can't fire him because she fired you.
Firing a young CEO and installing a much more experienced one
looks like leadership.
Firing two CEOs in a month looks like chaos.
Richard, look, I'm sorry,
but I think the box is here to stay.
Okay? Laurie's gonna have to pretend to be in favor of it.
She'll probably issue press releases
talking about how it's the
best application of your visionary technology.
Is there nothing that we can say to Laurie to change her mind?
If I could control Laurie,
do you really think I'd be looking
out my office door at that monstrosity?
Jeez, Monica, he's not that bad.
I mean, he's a little ugly, I guess.
Oh, the question mark. Sorry.
Mr. Gilfoyle. We're ready for you.
The guys cannot wait to see you again.
Again?
- Gilfoyle. - What the fuck?
Good to see you again, buddy. Why don't you have a seat?
You stole half of our algorithm.
You think you can bring me in here
and pay me to give you the rest?
No. We want you
because you're a full-stack engineer.
We already paid someone else for the missing piece of middle-out.
- Bullshit. - Do you know Naveen and Eric,
who, until very recently, headed up engineering at Nucleus?
- Hey, man. - What's up?
- Nope. - Well, I'm sure you at least recognize
the code they brought us.
That's exactly how they had it.
Okay. So, Endframe has our entire prediction loop,
down to the last fucking semicolon.
So, Nucleus stole half our IP,
and Endframe stole the other half.
And now they've knitted them together.
So, while we are busy building Barker's box,
Endframe is beating us to market with a platform.
So, basically, we are a fucking mediocre appliance company.
At least we'll make a little money doing it.
Oh, great. So, you can go back to the car wash
and buy some more chains.
Huh, Pakistani Mr. T?
Fuck you.
Wait. Are you not wearing it?
You're not. Did you take it off
- because I was fucking with you? - No.
It was itchy on my neck, so--
Bullshit.
That was a bad decision.
You flinched. Now the pain will never end.
I'm sorry to say it, but Gilfoyle's right.
You're making it worse. Sorry, Django.
Django?
Unchained.
Great. Now even fucking Jared is busting my balls.
I am. I'm-- I'm busting your balls.
You know what? If you're gonna give me shit for it anyway,
I'm just going to wear it.
Okay, Jared. Congratulations, by the way,
but we have our own balls to worry about, all right?
Look, how are we going to save the platform?
What choice do we have? Barker is the CEO.
We have to do what he says.
Or do we?
I don't know. I don't want to lie down for this, okay?
I don't want to just give up so easily.
Richard, unfortunately, in this case
I think we have to roll over and take it.
Or do we?
- Erlich, you have something to say? - Richard...
when George Washington founded a little startup
we've come to know as these United States of America,
and he was tired of getting shit from his CEO,
the King of England,
did he just roll over and take it from behind?
No. He called on his ride-or-die homeboys,
Tommy Jefferson, Benny Franklin,
and Alex Hamilton-- who was half-black, so that's Dinesh.
I'm not half-black.
He said, "Avast, ye fellow badasses,
let's build this country the way we motherfucking want to."
And so, Richard, if we want to build the platform,
all we need to do is...
build the platform.
That was underwhelming.
Perhaps you can go into slightly more detail?
We tell Barker exactly what he wants to hear.
That way, he thinks we're being good little boys.
But what we're actually doing
is building the platform. Think about it.
What's he gonna do?
- Call the cops. - Actually, no.
Erlich may be onto something.
If all we gave him was the platform,
Jack would have no other option
than to embrace it and say it was his idea all along,
because at that point, he can't tell Laurie the truth.
What? That he had absolutely no idea
what was going on inside of his own company?
He'd look like an idiot.
And Laurie wants the platform, anyway, so...
she'd be good for it.
Okay.
We build... a skunkworks.
A secret company inside the company.
We go all "Ocean's Eleven" on his ass.
Hold on. "Ocean's Eleven"?
It's a 2001 casino heist film,
starring Julia Roberts and 11 men.
I know what it is, Jared.
I'm saying not only are we going to have to engineer,
code, and stand up a full platform on our own,
we also have to make Jack and his sales weasels think
we're working on the box the entire time.
And if we fuck anything up and get caught,
he could take our stock and probably have us arrested.
- All right, I'm in. - Well, you're insane.
No, Dinesh, that chain is insane.
And not in the membrane.
Sorry, Cypress Halal.
Okay, Jared, settle down.
But this? This is fucking genius.
Okay, how do we even begin to pull it off?
Okay. Well, let's work through it.
I can generate fake status reports,
purchase orders, deliverables updates,
and I can liaise with sales to coordinate
what custom features we need to pretend to build.
Okay, great, yeah,
but faking the box is going to be the easy part.
Building the platform is the real challenge.
Gilfoyle, where are we on the server space?
That's gonna be tricky.
When we started moving out of the house, I dismantled Anton.
All the racks, GPUs, and cables are in storage at the office.
- We're gonna have to break him out. - That's a shit-ton of hardware.
Unless we do it one piece at a time,
like "Shawshank Redemption"
or "The Great Escape," You know?
I'd have bigger clothing on the day, but--
- Wait. - Wait.
I've got a better idea.
Let's say these Legos are Anton,
sad stacks of server components
lying dormant in storage.
Sneaking all of him out would be too difficult.
So, if we can't break Anton out,
maybe we can break in.
Stand the servers up right where they are.
- Can we do that? - Easy.
I can run cable through the drop panel in the ceiling
all the way to the building's main power panel.
When I pull a little bit of power
from each of the other tenants, no one will know.
Guys, I hate to keep shitting on your campfire,
but servers are not the real issue.
We have a manpower problem.
There's a ton of engineering to be done on the platform.
Yeah, he's right, but we have to pay them under the table.
I know just the right man for the job.
You guys are fucking nuts, but I dig it.
Here's the deal. I'm going to need the back pay you guys owe me
for when I was working for free,
not to mention lost wages from my old job.
Oh, and damages from when Jared sexually harassed me
into being friends with that Monica chick.
So... all that and you're in?
In? No.
That's just to keep me from telling Barker
about your secret project.
What? Are you serious?
Oh yeah.
Well, there goes most of our cash.
We just got extorted for $20,000.
Fuck Carla. She was dead weight, anyway.
- What's next? - I just thought of something.
It's a big problem, but I think I've got a solution.
Hello, this is Bertram Gilfoyle.
Yes, I'm still available,
and I would reconsider sitting down with you and your clients
if you send four large pizzas
to 5230 Newell Road
in 30 minutes or less.
Okay. I think that covers it.
We've thought of everything. We have a plan.
- Everybody in? - In.
- In. - Fuck yes, I'm in.
And I'm in to the idea of taking
a bigger leadership role in the company.
We're not gonna make the same mistakes--
Okay, Erlich, just-- just say, "in."
- We're all just saying, "in." - I'm in...volved.
Hey, you can't spell "involved" without an "in."
Just be in. Uh, Dinesh?
All right, fuck it, I'm in... but on one condition.
I'm going to need everyone to solemnly swear,
that they will no longer make fun of my gold chain.
Not a word ever again.
Well, guys, I think we can agree to that.
This plan better fucking work with a sacrifice like this.
Shall we drink from the teat of Pappy to celebrate?
I think I might actually enjoy going to work now.
Wait.
We can't enjoy going to work.
Meinertzhagen's haversack.
- What? - Meinertzhagen's haversack.
No one? Really?
No one's heard of Meinertzhagen's haversack?
Of course I have, Jared. Just explain it to them.
Well, it's a principle of military deception.
Essentially, it means you have to continue to act the part.
So, as far as anyone knows,
we're still building a box that we hate.
We need to act like it.
That's exactly right.
If we do anything differently, Barker's going to be onto us.
We have to keep complaining about Barker.
We have to keep bitching about the box.
We have to keep making fun of your gold chain.
We have to. We don't have any other choice, Dinesh.
but unfortunately, that chain is... Poison.
All right. To skunkworks!
Hey, all right. I don't usually drink
7:30 in the morning, but...
All right.
Hey, guys, look, we have to shred everything in this house
that pertains to skunkworks.
If anyone catches wind of anything that we've done here,
we are fucked.
Okay, you guys, this is it.
No turning back now.
Dinesh, I have a few premium chain insults
that I'm going to lay on you when we get in there.
Not for myself, obviously, but for the team.
I just might have one too. Sorry in advance.
Yeah. Great.
Have at it, assholes.
Hey, Dinesh, nice chain. Do you choke your mother with it
when you put your penis in her butthole?
What the fuck? Oh shit!
- Richard. - Here, I've got it.
No, no, no, that's private. Excuse me.
Skunkworks?
Private information.
Uh, Keith, where are you going?
Richard, why did you bring
all the skunkwork docs into the office?
You were supposed to shred those.
Yes, but I was gonna shred them here,
because we don't have a shredder at the house, do we?
Guys?
My office. Now.
Quite a plan you boys cooked up here.
Quite a plan.
I'm not sure what upsets me more,
that I have four employees
that conspired to commit felony fraud,
or that I have four employees that are so stupid
I found out about it within 30 seconds.
Hearing it out loud, the first one seems worse.
We got sales, manufacturing, design, assembly,
logistics teams, they're all ready to go.
All of them on the payroll, all of them here
to build me a box.
I have a deal, in principle,
with Maleant to buy the box.
The second that we deliver a product that meets those specs,
we are cashing checks!
And you are the only four people in this building
that are fighting me on it!
So give me one reason why I don't fire you right now,
claw back your options,
make you unhireable all over town,
one goddamn reason!
- Because you can't. - Excuse me?
This agreement says that you have ten weeks
to complete a working prototype before the deal expires.
So how are you gonna do that if you fire us?
There are maybe eight engineers on earth
proficient in middle-out compression.
Five of them work for Endframe, your competition,
and three of them are here in this office right now.
So if we're gone,
I don't think you're ever going to get your box.
What do you want?
I want to build my platform. Now.
To complete the box project
is going to take six months, at least.
So, what I think maybe we should do is, um,
take a little tip from your chart there,
and we, uh, compromise.
Compromise is the shared hypotenuse
of the conjoined triangles of success.
Mm-hmm, yep. So, uh... so, what I'm proposing
is we stand up the prototype, that's it.
We're not doing any custom features,
no new versions, no maintenance, nothing.
Richard, the Maleant basement.
And no onsite support. I think you can hire other engineers
to do that fucking mole monkey work.
The second we write code that satisfies
the basic minimum requirement of the deal,
we are off the box and on to the platform.
And that is my final offer.
So, what do you say to that action--
You okay? You were standing and then what happened?
It's just a little shocking. Oh... what were you saying?
Did you... do we have a deal or...?
Yeah, Richard, we have a deal.
You have a bloody nose.
That was pretty badass, Richard.
Until it wasn't.
Uh, this is not even a room. This is a hallway.
Uh, it can't be, because that is a bed,
thus, this is a bedroom.
Two entrances and exits, cross drafts ahoy.
And, uh, it is the safest room in the event, unlikely, of a fire.
Oh! Whoopsies. Don't mind me.
Ah, Fred, this is Jared. He actually is a,
a temporary resident.
Oh, uh, while I have you, there were fresh droppings near my cot.
I think you were right.
The Havahart traps don't seem to be working.
I was thinking maybe we could
just pick a day and just drench it in hawk urine,
because the scent of a predator can keep rodents at bay.
It's funny, we're named Pied Piper, but we're beset with rats.
Little rascals.
Fuck this. I've been writing quick, bullshit subpar code
for 48 hours and I want to kill myself.
How do you do it every day, Dinesh?
What a coincidence,
I've also been writing bullshit code for 48 hours,
and want you to kill yourself.
Guys, please. Let's just shit this thing out
so we can get on to building the platform.
Hi.
- Hi. - Dang.
- What? - I'm Dang.
- I'm Dang? - Dang.
- What... - My name is Dang.
Oh, my... I'm sorry. What, uh, what can I do for you?
I'm heading the design team
that's building the enclosure for the box.
- It's time for the concept meeting. - Concept meeting?
Okay. I'm just going to show you a few pictures,
and you tell me which ones you like, okay?
Okay. Sure.
Look, wait, hold on.
I thought you were going to show me pictures of boxes.
- Like data storage devices. - Before I can actualize a box,
you and I need to develop a shared aesthetic vocabulary.
Otherwise, I have no idea what you're going to want.
I have a lot of work to do right now.
This is work. This is my work.
What we're doing here could actually save time.
- Okay. Sure. Yeah. - Let's just make this simple.
If the box were an animal, what sort of animal would it be?
Leopard?
Butterfly? Rhinoceros?
Stop. Animal? Um, it's a box.
Right? Okay, so if you need an animal,
make it a box turtle. How does that sound?
So this is all kind of a joke to you?
You know what? I don't actually
give a flying fuck what this box looks like.
Okay, if it was up to me,
I wouldn't even have it in the first place.
So, look, here.
This is a black rectangle.
Make it that. All right? Because we're going to take it
and put it in a hole in a subbasement in a data center,
where no one can see it
except for a sad man named John with a ponytail.
Okay? Just make it a box.
And please turn off that fucking music.
Hello!
It appears there has been a mistake.
Is this not my parking space?
Sorry, a lot of premium spaces are being reassigned.
14-A, you've been reassigned to lot D.
Lot D?
The structure?
Beyond the freeway?
Anywhere above level three, those are reserved.
There's a shuttle stop on the ground level.
A shuttle?
Call Gavin Belson. Cell.
Greetings, friend, I'm not available right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
What the fuck? Why isn't this working?
Gilfoyle's preprocessor and my compressor
should integrate seamlessly. This should work.
I may have made my preprocessor
slightly faster than you asked me to, Richard.
What do you mean? How much slightly faster?
- 200 megs per second. - You dick.
That's eight times as fast as the specs required.
No wonder our modules aren't running at the same speed.
- Why would you do that? - I tried to make it slow.
I really did. But I'm not Dinesh.
It's very difficult for me to do shitty work.
So I added a differencing library
and then the whole thing just took off like a rocket.
Wait, so you're not processing whole files, just the changes?
That's actually pretty cool.
Yeah, I thought so too. That's why I wrote it.
All right, well, I guess I should just revert back.
Right? Slow my preprocessor way down.
Although, Richard, couldn't you just rewrite the compressor
to make it faster so it's compatible?
I mean, these are minimum speeds, right?
Just cause making the box sucks
doesn't mean we have to suck at making it.
Yeah. Okay. Um, here's one idea.
Uh, what if we actually move upstream and connect the parser...
directly to the compressor seed functions.
Okay.
Well, then the whole thing would really fly.
That would rock.
Hey, Richard, do you have a sec?
I have a, uh, preliminary render for you.
What is that?
What do you mean? It's a box.
That's not our box, is it?
Yes. It's exactly what you asked me for.
You drew a rectangle and
said if it was an animal, it'd be a box turtle.
I mean, are you just going
to do the bare minimum and call it a day?
Is that, like, what you do?
You said it didn't matter, you said you didn't care.
No one's caring about this. I'm just saying, like,
it's just a matter of pride and, like, self-respect.
I mean, that's going to go in brochures,
man, that's like an advertisement
to you and the company and everything.
I can maybe add some color to it
and give the bezel a little slam.
There you go. Definitely, a slam. Slam it.
Yeah, maybe add some more lights.
Sure. Yeah. Well, hey, uh,
what are you doing standing around here talking about it?
You should go do it, you know. Go and make the damn thing.
Make it a jaguar 'cause I have a feeling
this baby is going to purr.
I don't care either, but, you know,
I think maybe a gazelle is more like it.
Cause it's synonymous with speed.
Fuck that. A cheetah's faster.
And it kills fucking gazelles.
But I really don't fucking care.
- But definitely cheetah. - Or a gazelle.
Also, don't throw away the whole jaguar thing,
- 'cause they're pretty quick too. - Or a gazelle.
Ah! Jared, Jesus fuck! What are you doing?
Sorry. I was...
I was just taking a quiet moment to collect myself.
What the hell is all this shit?
My tenant has been leaving my belongings
in the alley behind my condo,
to make more room for his tenants.
- Your tenant has tenants? - Yeah.
He's Airbnbing my Airbnb. So, if it's okay with you,
I might need to stay a little bit longer, um...
I can go around the back to get to the bathroom once Fred's here.
- When's he moving in? - Wouldn't we all like to know.
Fred, Erlich Bachman.
You said you'd get back to me about the room.
I don't mean to pressure you, but I need you to decide now.
In this moment, on this phone call.
I am literally standing within feet of three potential candidates
whose selves I could easily tell to go fuck...
Good? What do you mean good?
What does that mean, you're good?
What? What other incubator? Where? What is the address?
Because I want to send them a fucking nice gift.
Fucking "Miami Vice," Disgusting architecture!
Hey, man. What are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here?
What do you mean? This is my house.
Crazy, right?
This place is huge.
Did you want to...?
Yes, it would be polite for you to invite me into your home
and offer me a Push Pop, yes.
I'm sorry. You're telling me
that we should spend less time together?
Absolutely, Chela.
Well, I have to say, this is a big relief.
In all candor, I was feeling the same,
but I thought that discussing it with you might be awkward.
Not at all.
You are ready, Chela, to stand on your own,
to weather the challenges of the future,
and the rumors swirling about your leadership.
Be well, Gavin.
I'm-- I'm sorry. Wait, what... what rumors?
There is talk that in the face of a growing threat
from Richard Hendricks and Pied Piper,
armed with a powerful new CEO,
- that you have done nothing. - Well, yes, but--
That by shuttering Nucleus,
you have left them to gather strength unopposed,
ceding the entire space.
Some are saying this is a show of great weakness.
Who? Who exactly is saying this?
Well, people talk.
In the halls, in the cafeteria, on the parking shuttle.
Wait, should... should I be worried about this?
The beauty is...
now you have all the answers.
Yes? All right.
Denpok, please.
Will you sit back down? I need your help.
- Of course. - Thank you.
Clearly, we have come far, but we still have far to go.
Not as far as lot D,
but far nonetheless.
Look what you guys built.
You can't help but be elegant, you're like Audrey Hepburn.
Ah, here they come.
Well, I know we made a big deal
about just doing your absolute minimum of your specs,
but one thing led to another and, well, Jack,
buckle your seatbelt because I'd like to introduce you to...
Richard, just save it.
Just got off the phone with Calvin Greene, CEO of Maleant.
- They're pulling out. - What?
How can they just pull out?
Because they shopped our deal
and got a better bid from another appliance maker,
so Maleant's out, they fucked us.
Yeah.
So, probably we should just push pause
on the whole box thing until we figure out where to go from here.
Okay. Uh, I... actually, I have a... I have a question.
Yeah, I know. I know. I know, Richard, we had an arrangement,
but that was all based on closing the Maleant deal.
- So now we have to figure out-- - No, no. Sorry, um...
No, my question is, uh, who did they go with?
Whose box do they think is that much better than ours?
- Oh, uh, Dectosphere. Dectosphere?
It's a brick with a power cord.
Yeah. But I hear their new 43-11s,
they're going to be hitting close to 75 megs per second.
Uh, we can do 200.
- What? - Yeah. You think you
can get me in a room with Calvin Greene?
This is the pool. The first night I was here,
I turned the heat, like, all the way up,
and half the water evaporated overnight. It's crazy.
Well, I hope you own a skimmer because there's a massive turd
floating on the surface of your pool.
Who, Fred? Fred's great, man.
He's got this really cool, um, malware cataloguing thing--
Cut the shit, Big Head. I see exactly what you're doing.
Poaching my tenants? You stole my business model.
What? No. Dude, it's not like that at all.
It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms.
You have any idea how scary that gets at night?
So I just wanted to have some roommates around,
but, um, you know, I felt weird
charging them rent, cause, you know.
No, I don't.
Well, it's like, 20 million, you know, so I don't really need it,
but then they felt weird living here without paying me anything,
so they offered me pieces of their startups. That's all.
You just admitted to starting a competing incubator.
I've caught you in a web of your own lies, haven't I?
I don't think so. Wait, have you?
All right, Big Head. You want to play it that way?
If it's a fight you want, then a fight you shall have.
All of you!
See you, buddy.
Big Head.
Fuck!
What are we doing here?
Why are we fighting like this?
I mean, I'm going to steal your guys,
you're gonna steal my guys.
We'll both wield the heft of our considerable fortunes
until each of us have nearly nothing left.
Is that really what you want? Me either.
So what do you say we join forces?
I'm big enough.
Are you, Big Head? Partners?
- Okay. - Attaboy.
All right, I'm going to take a spin
on that fancy Japanese toilet,
and then let's get to work
figuring out which one of these bedrooms
is going to be my office.
Consider the bulldog. A grotesque monstrosity
born of relentless inbreeding.
Riddled with sinusitis, crippled by joint pain.
Chronically flatulent.
A kindly pet, or humanity's cruelest mistake?
All right, take it away.
Ladies and gentlemen, just like that horrible creature,
the entire Nucleus program was the result of inbreeding.
We mated Hooli engineers with Hooli designers in a Hooli kennel.
Is it any wonder
the result was just as unspeakable as that thing?
Bring it back here.
Look at that hideous face.
All right, get it out of here!
I'm sorry, Gavin. What's your point?
My point is just as not all dogs are as flawed as the bulldog,
not all compression plays are as flawed as Nucleus.
Our execution was lacking, but the idea was correct.
Our only mistake was looking inward.
It is now time to look outward.
I mean, this guy did all of the work.
Ten minutes after we leave Calvin Greene's office,
he calls me up and says, "Hey, you got me. How much?"
I just showed them the box, Jack's the one who made the deal.
Good feelings, happy feelings.
So Big Head built a better version
of your incubator, accidentally.
- Correct. - And he didn't even realize it?
Also correct.
And your solution to that was to go into business with him?
Big Head? The guy you once called more useless
than a bag of dicks without a handle?
Dinesh, don't fall for his "Aw, shucks" Routine.
He is a shrewd businessman.
And together, we have over 20 million
and 36,000 dollars at our disposal.
Now, if you'll excuse me, on to Pied Piper.
I have a board meeting,
and this board ain't exactly gonna meet itself.
Our subsequent order of business
is the approval of Pied Piper's redraft
of the hardware requisition agreement
with Maleant Data Systems Solutions.
- Ah, yeah. - The main event.
We've all read the latest sales agreement, yes?
Actually, I don't think I was CC'd on--
So I believe we can move straightforward to a vote?
Actually, I'm sorry. I have an issue with, uh,
Section 14, Paragraph Two.
Um, it states that Maleant has exclusive rights
to purchase any appliance
made by Pied Piper for the next five years.
Oh, uh, yeah. Jack gave them exclusive rights to the box
so that we would get a better price upfront.
Right, but this language is far broader.
They actually have exclusive rights
to use the underlying algorithm in any form.
Oh, no. That's not right at all.
Yeah, so I think, Jack, we're going to have to go back to them
and just change the language here.
We're not going to be able to do that.
And, uh, why not?
Because that was the specific language which Maleant requested
when I got them to pay
three times as much for each one of our boxes.
It's a white label deal, so they have the right
to resell these boxes in any form they choose.
Yeah, but Jack, if they have exclusive rights to the algorithm,
then we can't use the algorithm to build the platform.
For five years.
They wanted seven, I talked them down.
I know, but you said that we could build the platform
once we gave you the box.
Yes, but I never specified a timeframe.
Are you serious?
I save your ass and you stab me in the back like this?
In the front, Richard.
Laurie, did you know about this?
- I did not. - Well, then, good, okay.
So it won't go through,
because Laurie's not going to vote for it.
Richard, this is complicated.
If one goes strictly by the numbers, these numbers,
you have built a box that is so valuable,
I am now obligated to vote in favor of it.
Laurie, this deal is peanuts. The platform could be worth
a thousand times what the box is worth.
It could be, correct, however--
This is theoretical, Richard.
You don't have a price point, I do,
and she has a fiduciary obligation as a member of the board
to vote for the box. On the page,
this is in the best interest of the company.
Am I wrong, Laurie?
That is factually correct.
You remember when you tried to end run me and kill the box?
Well, she couldn't do a goddamn thing about it then.
And she can't do a goddamn thing about it now.
Simple majority ratifies the agreement, all in favor.
Are you kidding me? What the fuck is going on right now?
- Laurie. - I wasn't carbon copied on this particular email,
so I stand with Richard.
Um, Richard,
you know how I voted to fire you a couple months ago?
And I said that I did it to stay in the game
so that maybe at some point in the future,
I could do something to help?
Well, Laurie,
I know you'll probably replace me on the board
and call for a revote tomorrow,
but I'm here today.
And I don't have any metrics to back it up,
but I honestly believe
that the platform that Richard wants to build
will be far more lucrative in the long term than any box.
So, at least for today, I'm voting no.
Motion denied.
We will be reconvening tomorrow.
And if I could get a, uh,
an email, be CC'd on the latest draft...
I couldn't sit there and watch them do that to you.
I just hope I don't end up fired over this.
Well, what you did took incredible guts.
And the fact that it probably won't make any difference
makes it all the more meaningful.
Right, I saw this nature documentary where a bison fought a lion
to protect the rest of the herd. And it was so moving.
Um, it didn't work, the lion, uh, tore into the bison
and then laid waste to the herd, but what courage.
Thank you, Jared.
You guys just had to make a great box, didn't you?
You couldn't phone it in.
Uh, guys, Gavin Belson is calling me. Again.
- What the fuck does he want? - Hello?
Richard Hendricks, just checking in,
seeing if you heard the news.
What news?
Obviously, you don't have your Hooli news alerts up to date.
Go to the site. I'll wait.
- Go to the Hooli news website. - Okay.
It's an ad.
Um, it's an ad. Hold on.
Just wait four seconds, and you can click to skip it.
Just wait four seconds and then you can click it.
No, it's the kind
where you have to watch the whole fucking thing.
It's the whole ad kind.
I thought we stopped doing those. Goddamn it.
Well, regardless, what you'll see
once the paid announcement is over,
is that I just closed a 250 million dollar deal
to acquire a little company called Endframe.
I thought you'd want to know. Update those Hooli news alerts.
Also, I invite you to click yes,
if our ad experience was relevant to you. Be well, Richard.
What did he say?
Oh, my God.
"Gavin Belson announces deal to acquire Endframe,
"A middle-out compression platform company,
for 250 million dollars."
Even after they shit the bed with Nucleus,
Hooli gets to build our platform and we don't?
- What is funny about this? - He's intoxicated.
No. No... yes, but don't you see?
Gavin, in trying to fuck us, just saved our asses.
He's right. He's right.
My gosh. Oh, my gosh, he's right.
- Holy shit. - I am so confused right now.
Gavin set a p--
- He set the-- - The price point.
- Yes. - Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, thanks to Gavin, Endframe,
a middle-out compression platform,
is objectively worth 250 million dollars.
Wait, okay. We are a middle-out compression platform company.
Are we worth 250 million dollars?
There's no way the box makes us worth a fraction of that.
Laurie couldn't vote for the platform
because she couldn't assign a dollar value to it.
Well, Gavin has just done that.
He's validated the market so there's...
there's no reason to revote. We win.
I can't wait to see the look on that AAR prick's face
when we come in there and gut him like a--
- Is he okay? - He's going to be fine.
Welcome, men and ladies of Endframe.
Rather than incestuously promoting the same faces from within,
you represent fresh blood, new ideas.
Everything Nucleus was not.
It is my honor to personally welcome you all to Hooli.
Does he really not remember us?
How long did you work at Hooli? The last time?
Seven years.
I was here for nine. He was invited to my wedding.
I hope Jack doesn't cry.
I really hope he does.
Hey, Gloria. Lynn.
- Did they both get fired? - I don't...
Laurie. What are you doing here? Where's Jack?
Uh, as you may recall, at our board meeting last night,
Jack said that he would get his way, and that, in his words,
I, quote, "Couldn't do a goddamn thing about it," End quote.
Well, in light of recent activities,
it appears that I could do a goddamn thing about it.
And I just did. Jack Barker has been exited.
- Fuck me sideways. - Indeed.
Effective immediately,
you are all at liberty to commence work upon the platform.
Okay.
Yeah, uh, uh, I just got to ask, um,
with Jack not being CEO anymore, am I CEO again?
You are not.
Nor are you, Mr. Bachman.
I'm sorry, if I'm not CEO, Erlich isn't, Jack isn't,
who is going to run Pied Piper then?
Officially, and until further notice,
this chair will remain empty.
- Really? - Excuse me.
Okay, here's another one.
TechCrunch says, "Laurie Bream spotted lunching at the Rosewood
"With yet another rising tech star, Sam Herron.
Could this finally be the new CEO of Pied Piper?"
Maybe she's just fucking them all.
It's been ten days. You know what would be nice?
If I found out what Laurie wanted to do with my company from her
instead of the fucking Internet.
Richard, the accountants finally agreed to release our books.
Okay.
Hey, Richard. Is there anything we should be doing?
I don't know. Why are you asking me?
I'm not the CEO. There is no CEO.
Because, apparently, Jack's
empty fucking chair is a better choice than I am.
So, maybe-- maybe ask the chair, see what it thinks.
Say what you will about the chair,
but at least it never told me to build a fucking box.
True. Compared to Richard, it's a lot sturdier.
And it has a lot less of Barker's ass rubbed all over it.
Are you serious?
On top of Jack's ridiculous severance package,
we spent a thousand dollars on each one of your fucking monitors?
We did? Huh. That's very pricey.
So what? Raviga funded us for $5 million.
There's no way we burned through all that.
Do you have any idea how these deals work? That money's tranched.
What's that?
Well, from the Old French for "Slice."
Yeah, try to keep up, Dinesh.
We get our money in stages.
Right? We get $2 million upfront
to get us going, to design and build the product,
but we don't get the next
three million until we take a product to market.
And Jack was okay with hemorrhaging money,
because he thought we were launching the box
and then getting the next three million in the next few weeks.
But the platform will take way longer to launch than that.
Yes. So we are effectively a $250 million company
who just took $5 million in funding
and now we're dead-ass broke.
Our burn rate is astronomical,
and every day we sit in limbo like this...
What if we don't?
What if we don't sit in limbo?
Like fuck limbo, right?
I mean, right now,
let's-- let's fire all these fucking sales assholes,
and break the lease on this place and get the fuck out of here.
Can we do that? There's no CEO here to approve any of that.
Yeah. There's also no CEO here to tell me not to do it, right?
That's right. You're the CTO.
Technically, you're the ranking officer.
Fucking A.
Look, when, or if, a new CEO comes to take over the company,
we will do what they say to the best of our abilities.
But there is a very real possibility
that there won't be a company for them to take over
if we don't do something about it now.
- So, no more surprise waffles. - What?
- No more Chef Amy. - No!
And no more of these stupid offices, okay?
We're going to move back to the hostel.
Fuck.
Dinesh, we need to cut every corner, save every penny,
and plow it into engineers to build the platform. Okay?
Then we will be back on track.
So Gilfoyle, Dinesh, pack up those gold-plated monitors
because we are selling them.
Jared, come on. Let's do this.
Well, that sucks.
Jesus.
Okay, guys. Can I have your attention, please!
Yeah, next goal wins.
No. Uh, not-- Now. Sorry, it's got to be now.
And so, bring it in, Dang,
Chef Amy, Jan the Man, Keith, Northeast regional.
And do you still have your shadow?
- Yo! - Hey, there he is.
Okay, uh... circle up.
All right, I have some news for you.
Is this about the new CEO?
Re/Code is saying it could be Reid Hoffman.
No. I... don't know anything about that.
No, no. There's no new CEO. There's no new employees of any kind.
There's actually-- It's
more about you guys becoming former employees.
So, look...
We're heading in a different direction.
And what that means is, if I haven't taken you aside
and spoken to you privately about staying on,
that does mean that you are... terminated, immediately.
So, Dang, Chef Amy, Jan the Man, all of Sales,
I am, uh, really sorry about all this.
Are you sure that you can fire us, like, legally?
Yeah. Yes, absolutely.
I'm CTO. I'm the highest ranking officer, so yes, answer.
You're-- you're still CTO? Laurie hasn't fired you yet?
No, she has-- Why would she fire me?
Well, Code/Rag said that your tech is mediocre
and that's why no one will take the CEO job.
- What? - Yeah.
That's why I assumed that you'd been fired.
Uh, maybe she's waiting till Friday to fire him.
Oh, that makes sense.
No, it doesn't make sense. That's not what's happening, okay?
I'm not getting fired. That's crazy.
I haven't read this article. Okay, maybe I'm too busy
making the tech awesome, because it's not mediocre.
It's actually-- turns out, it's fucking revolutionary.
So, I guess that's the truth.
And also, I'm not fired,
these guys aren't fired, you all are fired.
Everyone from this wall is fired. So, enjoy being fired.
Jesus! This is a good apple.
Where did you get this?
Oh, I have a fruit guy.
Fantastic. Read me back what we have so far.
Uh, "Bachman and Bighetti shall each include in this venture
"Any and all portfolio companies.
The exception shall be for Pied Piper."
Hey, how-- how come Pied Piper is not a part of it?
'Cause, you know, I actually
used to work there, so maybe it should be?
Big Head, Pied Piper is no longer an incubating entity.
It would be unfair to you and to me and to them for me
to relinquish any of my shares in their company.
And besides, like you,
I'm giving up everything else I have of value--
shares, options, cash, liquid assets.
Wait. So all my assets?
That seems like kind of a lot.
It is a lot, Big Head. We're both giving up a lot.
And we're both gaining a lot also.
And that's what every successful partnership is about.
Committing fully, blindly,
and without concern of the consequences,
- like marriage. - Right.
Oh, here. Get this down.
In the event of a tie vote,
any disagreement shall be settled
with a toss of a coin of Mr. Bachman's choosing.
What the fuck are you doing in here?
Can't you see we're having a meeting?
Go ahead, Big Head, read that back to me.
"In the event of a tie--"
The fucking juicer's broken!
This is he second one in two days!
CJ Cantwell of Code/Rag writes, and I quote,
"Having met this many candidates without closing one,
"One can't help wonder why Pied Piper can't land a man.
"Could the vaunted tech of founder Richard Hendricks,
"Whom I once called 'the next Mark Zuckerberg,'
be turning Pied Piper from
a unicorn into a donkey wearing a party hat?"
And?
And, she's slandering my tech.
It's the one thing that's working around here.
Look, I think if I just talk to her,
I can get her to change it.
No. I do not want you to engage with a muckraker like CJ Cantwell
simply to salve your male ego.
My male ego has nothing to do with this, Laurie.
Look, good coders won't want to work
for a company they think has shitty tech.
I need to get ahead of this now.
And if I don't, we're done.
Richard, whether you appreciate this or not,
I do actually have a plan here.
You can meet with everyone in Palo Alto to replace me as CEO.
I'm not going to tell you how to do your job.
Okay, but I need to do something about this, now.
She-she-- she's calling us the next Clinkle.
Clinkle, Laurie. Clinkle.
You-- you do know what happened to Clinkle, right?
Do you want us to be Clinkle?
Please, just stop saying "Clinkle."
It jars the ear. Fine.
I will have my office set up an interview.
But I want you to present yourself well, Richard.
Be showered, groomed, well-dressed.
And you will need to sit down with
our head of PR beforehand to go over talking points.
Why?
Because you are in an emotional state,
and when you are emotional,
you become highly inarticulate.
Well, I don't say that's true.
Okay. Yes. Fine. Sure.
And thank you, Laurie.
Before you ask, the answer is yes.
I did blow all these hard drives clean.
- So... - You really are a moron.
The only way to really blow the hard drives clean
is to take a drill and punch a hole through it.
All right, calm down, Snowden. I zeroed them all out, we're fine.
Welcome, welcome.
we have lost our lease, so everything must go.
The chairs are arranged in ascending order of lumbar support.
So, have a gander.
Oh, uh, word to the wise:
the Haworths are like a spa day for the buttocks.
Yeah, and I have a fragile posterior.
My aunt used to call me "Glasshole."
So, you can take it from me.
Look at these fucking maggots.
Crawling all over our garbage,
leaving their slime of mediocrity.
I thought you'd feel right at home in a marketplace,
haggling, selling your monkey paws,
looking for Indiana Jones in a wicker basket.
Okay. Marion was in the wicker basket,
Indiana Jones was tipping them over, you fucking idiot.
Hi.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Well, how about that? I made my first sale.
I've organized a lot of estate sales,
so this is kind of my wheelhouse.
- What? - I have a lot of elderly friends.
Oh, that is a fun item.
That's a hardware fan.
You've got the yellow hoodie on today.
Oh, yeah.
Wait a second.
None of these are signed.
Oh yeah. Um, it's just my business manager had some questions
about the way some of this stuff was being arranged.
Like he said something about how it's not a corporation.
It's just a general partnership or something.
I mean, he told me I didn't understand, which is true,
so he wanted to maybe talk to you about it.
So you want to lawyer up, huh? Is that what we're doing?
I don't think he has a law degree.
Big Head, I would hope that
a handshake deal would be good enough for you.
Because we're headed down a long road,
and that road must be paved with trust. Blind trust.
And you bringing in these so-called "Experts..."
...really gives me pause,
and it insults my honor.
Sorry, hold on. I got to take this. I'll be right back.
Sorry. Hello?
Hey. Uh, how do I look?
If I'm being honest, like a ventriloquist dummy.
Okay. Well, you know, that's actually kind of fitting,
because I'm on my way to Raviga right now
to meet with a PR person to tell me exactly what to say
to a reporter and how to say it.
Well, that does make sense.
You do tend to babble on when you're under pressure.
Why does this thing people say?
Why indeed?
That was weird.
I just got a call from Laurie Bream's office, at Raviga,
asking if I'd want to interview for the job of CEO at Pied Piper.
What? Are you fucking kidding me?
That's exactly what I said.
Then I said no, and then we both hung up.
I mean, I assume they hung up. I had already hung up, so...
Wow. Wow. Okay.
Okay. Yeah, great. Big Head.
Big Head! Fucking kidding me?
What the fuck is going on?
Big Head, you can insult me all you want
by involving your self-described shylocks,
but to insult Richard and humiliate him,
that's like kicking a child who's done nothing to deserve it.
I may not be able to finish my ramen.
I told them no.
Hi there. Richard Hendricks here to see Dawn Simon, PR.
Sure, she'll be meeting you in the small conference room.
- Do you need me-- - No, no. I, uh--
I know where it is. It turns out, I actually know something.
I'm not a fucking idiot.
- Richard Hendricks. - Hi. Before we get any further,
I just want you to know that,
I'm not going to be yelling at you,
but I probably am going to yell.
- Okay. - Okay.
Because this is bullshit.
Honestly, I mean, I get it. This is your job. You're in PR.
Your job is to pretty much tell me what I can't say.
I mean, when I talk to this reporter, I probably can't say
how fucked up it is that, um, Laurie Bream fired me,
and then replaced me with Action Jack Barker.
I probably can't say how the only action he took was
to essentially pick the wrong product
and then bleed the company dry.
And I probably can't say how fucking pissed off I am
that Laurie Bream is out there gallivanting around the Valley,
interviewing every dickhole on Earth for my job,
including Big Head--
a man that I fired by the way, and no offense, I like him.
I do actually, he's a close friend of mine,
been that way for years.
He is a bit of a simpleton, his name's fucking Big Head.
But, okay, look.
I want to be CEO of Pied Piper, okay?
It is my company. I worked my ass off to build this company, okay?
That's my job. I deserve it.
And it fucking kills me that Laurie is out there
trying to give it to someone else, anyone but me.
But I probably can't say that, can I?
You can say anything you want to say to me.
All right.
Thank you for meeting me, Monica.
You are from...?
Baltimore.
HL Mencken hails from Baltimore.
Who?
Widely perceived as a racist, but...
his work on the English language is comprehensive,
and his perspicuous skewering of evangelicals is laudable.
Monica, my mission here is not merely to have fun.
That's-- that's okay.
When I voted against you, at the board meeting, I just want--
Monica, this is not about you, for once.
I brought you here to say...
I am sorry.
For...?
Yes, of course. You are going to make me say it.
Why am I not surprised?
I made a mistake with Richard Hendricks.
And out I went, right on my ass.
And then Laurie put that
jackhole Barker in to bankrupt the company.
But does she cop to that? No, no, no.
Because the Laurie-tron 6,000
isn't programmed to admit when she's made a mistake.
I made an error.
That's really big of you to admit.
I should not have removed him as CEO,
and installing Jack Barker
in his place only compounded that error.
But if that's true,
then why are you meeting with so many other CEO candidates?
I am meeting publically with a number of
high-value candidates I know to be unavailable,
as well as with a number of less-qualified candidates
with whom Richard compares favorably.
That's why you called Big Head.
Yes. You see, Richard must not be perceived
as being the most expedient candidate.
He must be seen as the correct candidate.
This is very exciting for Richard.
I have been impressed by his conduct in a tough situation.
- He's shown mettle. - Definitely.
Therefore, I will call for a vote at the next board meeting
to offer him the job.
That is of course assuming he
continues to demonstrate an air of professionalism.
Hi, Dawn. Are you waiting for someone?
Yes. I'm supposed to be meeting with Richard Hendricks
before he sits down with a Code/Rag reporter.
Oh, that's weird. I saw him earlier.
And that is why...
I'm just being honest here.
I think that Peter Gregory is better off where he is.
Just saying, because if he knew
what Laurie was doing to his company,
he probably would want to take a gun and blow his brains out.
Uh, okay.
We should probably start talking about the things that I can say.
Richard. Richard Hendricks?
Yes. Who are you?
Dawn Simon, Raviga's publicity director.
So that would make you...?
CJ Cantwell, Code/Rag.
Thank you, I think I have everything I need.
Please tell me that went well.
Yep. No, yeah. It, uh-- it-it was gone great.
Yep. It had gone.
It was great.
Uh, she's a-- she's a great guy.
Really. Gir-- girl. She's-- she's cool. She's a cool one.
Cool. Um, so I can just-- I can get out here?
- Just 'cause I got another thing. - Yeah.
Slow down. Listen to me. Look, in my defense,
I said those were all the things I can't say, okay.
So it's kind of like I didn't even say them.
But you did say them, at a meeting you scheduled with a reporter.
Reporter? Come on, you're a tech blogger.
Really. Hard to see why Laurie insisted on a PR rep for you.
Look, uh, just... tell me what I can do to kill this?
- You want me to spike the story? - Yes, please.
Give me something better. I don't know,
go on a drunken racist Twitter rant,
or, uh, get in your car, run over Elon Musk,
and give me an exclusive from jail. Yeah.
Otherwise, I'm posting this at noon tomorrow, so...
No, no, no, no. Look. Look.
If you want to leave, you're going to have to run me over!
These offices were nice.
Now everything looks so bare.
Yeah. There is a certain sad vulnerability to it.
Have you ever seen a naked dead person?
No. No. No.
Well, the good news is, we cleared almost...
$70,000 from selling all this stuff.
That's not enough to afford all the coders we need.
We need at least a dozen.
Where would we even put them now?
Shall we?
Wait. Where's my hard drive?
What did it look like?
It just looked like a normal standard hard drive.
You sure it was in your bag?
Yeah, it was in my bag.
Could it maybe have slid out and was next to your bag,
which was next to all the hard drives we got rid of?
Did you sell my personal hard drive?
You didn't happen to wipe that one clean, too, did you?
- My personal hard drive? - Yeah.
No!
Fuck!
So it had our confidential IP on it?
Yes. All the work we did on the platform, the box, everything.
Well, what's gone is not necessarily lost.
Okay, we just need to find it.
I found my retainer in the school dumpster.
I found my biological father in a militia up in the Ozarks.
This should be no problem.
Don't worry, Dinesh, we'll find it.
Uh, does he not know we're moving out?
Should we tell him?
No. Jack paid him in full up front, and...
he seems so at peace.
All right. All right.
I am such an idiot.
You've got no choice, Richard.
You need to go in to Laurie and just tell her what happened.
What? It's bad enough she's going to find out
what I said after this piece posts online.
You want me to go in and tell her right to her face?
No fucking way.
You could spin it. Tell her you're sorry.
I had it. I had my old CEO job back,
and I fucked it up.
I'll get it.
The Super Angel Premium Deluxe.
In the flesh.
Yeah, I had to drive to
San Mateo to get one that has auto-reverse.
Why didn't you send your assistant?
She was on the phone, so...
Well, Big Head,
it takes a brave man to admit his mistakes,
and with this token of apology,
you've officially righted your wrong.
Consider the matter resolved.
Cool.
Traditionally the offender shakes the offendee's hand,
so you would come to me.
That's an honest Thomas.
Gentlemen, Monica, from the ashes of whatever happens here
will rise the Phoenix that shall be known as Bachmanity.
That's what you're going to call your company?
Yeah, well, before it was going to be Bachman Capital.
Because I provide the Bachman, and he provides the capital.
Yeah, but then, we compromised, and made it Bachmanity,
'cause it's Bachman from him,
and then the "Etti" from me. So it's two syllables each.
Very much into keeping score, this one. Have a seat.
I'll go fetch the documents and my Montblanc.
So, slight hiccup. I tracked down the woman who bought the drive,
but she wasn't interested in selling it back.
Apparently, she's already given it to her elderly father
and booked the Geek Squad to set it up for him this afternoon.
What about my drive?
All our stuff is on there.
I think we're fine. She said he mostly uses the computer
to download photos of old ships.
I don't think he'll be able to find our files
even if he wanted to.
Well, I mean, hopefully. But still...
Dinesh is right, this is sloppy.
Where does this guy live?
Oh shit, Richard, I'm sorry, man.
Initial here and here.
No. It's okay. I-- I deserve it. It's my own fault.
And you're going to want to sign here.
Still man, that just really sucks.
You know, I bet-- I bet you
wish you could just scrub the whole Internet,
like Gavin Belson does, right?
Whoa, weird.
Every single one of my signatures looks totally different.
- Wait. What? - Yeah, look.
This one's in cursive, this one's just printed, and then I,
one I just wrote "Big Head," But that's not going to hold up.
No, no, no.
Did you just say Gavin Belson scrubbed the Internet?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, and then they told me to my face,
that after Nucleus was shut down,
Gavin had one of his execs order them to scrub
all negative mentions of Nucleus off of Hooli Search.
Okay, when exactly did this happen?
No, no. Actually, uh...
you told me that you would spike my story
if I give you something better.
This is better, right?
Yeah. Light-years better, actually. Your story's spiked.
Great, okay.
As long as we're trading apples for comparable apples,
I've got a fresh and juicy that's ripe for the picking.
Ms. Cantwell, what say you to an exclusive
on the launch of a future financial behemoth?
How about we just stick with Gavin?
Gavin for Richard? Deal?
Done.
Monica, do you really need to be here?
- Geek Squad. - The computer's right here.
You're not wearing the shirt.
I spilled coffee on it.
I'm a nerd.
All right. We're all set here.
Yes!
Can I have my hard drive?
Oh, no. You fucking dick.
Shit.
You're gonna be replacing it.
You're back. How did the board meeting go?
You're looking at the past, present,
and possibly future CEO of Pied Piper.
That is fab-
- Congratulations! - Jared--
My captain!
"O captain! My captain! Rise up and hear the bells.
Rise up-- for you the flag is flung-- for you the bugle trills."
All right. Dismissed.
Well, uh, just to remind you,
Pied Piper is still a sinking ship, so...
Enough with the maritime metaphors.
This is honestly like the best birthday gift
that I ever could've asked for.
- It's your birthday? - Oh, I don't know.
The CPS worker couldn't find my birth certificate,
but... maybe now it is.
And in other good news,
we've managed to fill out our engineering team.
Did you tell them that my Fage's off-limits?
Oh, that-- that won't be a worry.
Come meet them.
All right, guys, who wants
to start work on the fragment uploader?
Uh, Gleb, why don't you and Sanjay take it?
Richard, say hi.
Yes, uh, hello. I am, uh, Richard Hendricks,
the CEO of Pied Piper. Welcome aboard.
What the fuck is going on here?
We got a little creative.
I read that the woman who started Pegg'd
built her entire app using a team
of coders from India, she never met in person.
And it only cost $15,000.
So, yeah, so we figured why limit ourselves
to a few expensive people in the Valley,
when we could afford a full complement if we outsourced?
Richard, I know we said that we sold everything in the offices
to pay for these guys, but that was not exactly true.
we kept one thing.
Okay.
It's the CEO chair.
Have a seat.
Okay.
Okay, uh...
Well, uh, why don't we, uh,
go around the room or screens or whatever,
and, uh, introduce ourselves?
Hello, my name is Gleb. I am in Bulgaria.
Hello, I am Sanjay. I am here in Mumbai, India.
- You having trouble? - No.
I am Elisabet. I am speaking to you from Estonia.
Uh, thank you for the--
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.
I got it. I got it.
You're making a great first impression.
Sorry. Can we go to the-- do the names one more time?
Okay, one extra-large, virgin margarita.
- Thank you, Richard. - What took you so long?
I actually, uh, I met a girl.
It's called the bartender, she works here.
No, no. It's a real girl.
And I actually got her real phone number.
Check you out, Mr. Casanova.
Where is this individual?
She's right over there.
- The tall dude? - No, behind him.
Oh, she must be hiding
behind that attractive girl in the red sweater.
No, it is the attractive girl in the red sweater.
Can we stop looking at her?
She's magnificent.
Are you sure it's not the tall guy?
Why are we surprised that young Richard
is garnering the attention of ladies?
After all, he's king again. Women like that.
Okay, so she's a founder hounder.
Come on, no, it-- it's not like that.
But you did tell her that you're the CEO of your own company?
It came up. But I mean, honestly,
how else was I going to explain that me
and my friends were at a bar?
That is a good point.
Anytime you're near a woman,
it is important to explain why.
Otherwise, they get nervous.
Gentlemen...
To Pied Piper's past, and now present CEO.
- Oh, what about future? - Jared, we'll worry about that later.
Tonight it's about Richard.
To Richard.
I think you'll find I'm a... I'm a... I'm a pretty tolerant boss,
but, Gleb, your-- your last commit, you did use spaces over tabs.
I don't know why you'd commit to that,
so just tell me why on earth
you-- you would do something like that?
Is not so big a deal. They're very much the same, yes?
Yes, yes, he's right. They're very much the same.
No, no, sorry, they're-- they're not the same.
At least, not in my book. Um, um, one is right,
and the other is wrong.
Why didn't anyone tell Gleb to use tabs?
Yeah, we did. And it's in the company style guide.
I just don't think Gleb
realized how seriously Richard takes this stuff.
Yeah, I've honestly never understood it myself.
I mean, once the code goes through the compiler,
there's effectively no difference.
I know, but coders go, like, batshit over it.
At Hooli, I once saw two engineers get into a fight so vicious,
- they almost made physical contact. - What?
Okay, guys, uh, back to work.
Uh, Gleb, Sanjay, everyone, do you understand tabs?
Yes, yes. You have made this very clear as clear as crystal.
Okay. Good, that's my little thing,
and I'll hand you back to Dinesh now.
He's, uh, he's the man with the plan,
and the, uh, pretty cool tan.
- It's not a tan, it's-- - Yeah, I know, I know.
Sorry.
This is how I was born.
Hey, uh, Elisabet? Hi.
before you go, I just wanted to say that
I thought your last commit was very impressive.
Thank you.
Almost as nice as the fingers that typed it.
Just call it like I see it. Thank you.
Speaking of seeing, I will see...
- you tomorrow. - Yes. You will.
- Bye-bye, Dinesh. - Bye, Elisabet.
Yuck.
What? You don't actually think she was flirting, do you?
She works here. She's paid to interact with you.
Just like that bartender
that Richard thought he was flirting with.
Actually, she's not a bartender.
And for your information, we've been trading texts.
And, uh, we're going for drinks later, so...
Great. If you go to the bar she works at,
you can probably drink for free.
Again, uh, not a bartender.
Okay, she works at Facebook.
So she makes a lot more money than I do or you do.
And, um, she's definitely not a founder hounder. So... sorry.
Yeah, none of that adds up.
Hey, guys, check out Code/Rag.
What, did the Gavin piece post?
Indeed it did.
Oh, "Gavin Belson's Hooli-Scrub Scandal." Awesome.
Man, Gavin cannot be happy about this.
Stay close.
Back up, back up.
You're on private property, back to the sidewalk.
- You're gonna get arrested. - Hey, Gavin!
Hello, I'm...
You know, a hundred years ago,
men like me could've had people like that killed.
Just like that. You think
captains of industry like Andrew Carnegie
or Cornelius Vanderbilt would've batted an eyelid? Please.
Times sure have changed.
Or have they?
Of course they have. And for the better.
Unless...
All right, forget it. What are we doing about this article?
Can we sue this Cantwell woman for libel?
Gavin, libel laws don't really apply when what's written is true.
It's my understanding you did in fact instruct Nucleus engineers
- to obscure negative Hooli-Search-- - I know what I did.
Forget libel. What about this unnamed
Hooli insider she keeps quoting.
Everything this person is saying is obviously covered
by a nondisclosure agreement. Let's sue that person.
We don't know who that person is.
And reporters generally don't give up their sources.
Well, then I'll just have to
light a fire under this reporter's ass, won't I?
You know, there was a time, not so long ago,
when it could've been a literal fire.
But as discussed, those days are gone.
Unless...
All right, forget it. You people are useless.
Thank you. You're excused.
It's Gavin Belson for CJ Cantwell, please.
She'll know what it's regarding.
Now, the stage should be here.
With Yeezy or someone comparable.
Now, I have yet to land on a theme.
Most people who rent Alcatraz
for parties tend to go with the prison theme.
how much would it cost to make this look
as if it were never a prison at all?
Spare no expense,
and if you think it would be cool,
I would love to have some sort of chocolate moat here,
with little boats floating down
a field with graham crackers and marshmallows.
It's been a childhood dream of mine.
And get the best chocolatier, we want to impress.
I'm inviting every asshole from the Valley to attend.
You're inviting assholes?
Absolutely. Assholes, shit dongles,
any foe or enemy I've made
over my storied career will be here.
That way, when I take this
stage and unleash the power of Bachmanity,
they'll all be in the front row.
Erlich, uh, can we talk for a second?
What is it, Big Head? I thought I told you
to go watch something on your iPad.
I think we may have a problem.
That Code/Rag reporter I talked to
says that Gavin Belson is threatening to sue her
if she doesn't tell him who she spoke to.
- So? - So, she spoke to me.
No publicity is bad publicity. This might be great timing.
Exactly the reason that we are partners.
Okay, yeah. Except if Gavin
finds out it was me that talked to the reporter,
then he'll know I violated my NDA.
And then he could come
after my entire settlement if that happens.
All two million. I mean, 20 million.
Big Head, I'm not going to yell.
And I'm not going to hit you.
I'm just gonna ask you nicely,
why in the holy fuck didn't you tell me you signed an NDA,
you sweet, helpless, little piece of shit?
Well, that's the thing about the NDA,
is that the NDA is actually covered under the NDA.
So if I told you about the NDA,
it would've been a violation of the NDA.
And what about speaking with the reporter? What would that be?
Yeah. Shit.
So, what do you think I should do?
- I could call her back and-- - No!
Let me handle it. You go wait in the helicopter.
- Go. - Okay.
Sasha, I'm going to need to go back to the mainland.
- Oh, is there a problem? - Oh, no, no. Full steam ahead.
Mainland.
This is an island.
That's the theme.
Hawaiian.
We'll have a luau.
Yeah, somebody called me that in high school,
and the nickname just stuck.
Pakistani Denzel.
I mean, I don't see it. But everybody else does. So...
Maybe they should call him American Dinesh?
Stop.
Only if you stop first.
- No, you stop first. - You stop first.
- You go first. - No, I think you should.
Okay, I'll stop. Bye.
What's your end game here? You think after your tired rap,
she's going to hop on a plane, fly halfway across the world,
- and fuck you? - My motivations are pure.
Her and I have, like, a real connection.
She's so, like, nice and she's so down to earth,
that it's like she has no idea how attractive she is.
You don't know how attractive she is.
Packet loss over Estonian broadband is terrible.
She could be hideous.
Well, I can't imagine that would matter to Dinesh one iota.
Right. Cause she's nice,
and, uh, very talented, and has a great laugh.
And with any luck, she's not a dogface.
How was your date with Winnie?
Uh, well, pretty good,
considering she's still in the other room.
Baller, you got lucky on the first date.
Yeah, did a little bit, uh, not everything.
I mean, I slept in my jeans.
Well, take your time. Hunger is the best sauce.
You're right. Uh, we did a little bit of under the shirts
and, like, finger banging. Oh, hey.
Hey, I'm Winnie.
- Hi, I'm Dinesh. - Hi, I'm Jared.
- It is an honor to meet you. - Okay.
- God, what a pleasure. - Thanks.
I'm Gilfoyle. Are you a bartender?
- I work at Facebook. - As a bartender?
I had a stuffed animal named Winnie.
I mean, it wasn't technically an animal,
I took a Ziploc bag and I stuffed it with old newspaper
and then I-- I drew a smile on it.
Okay, well, uh, shall we have some coffee, my lady?
- Sure. Let's do it. - Okay. All right.
We're already on to Elizabethan nicknames. This is serious.
- They'll be Ren Faire-ing soon. - It's healthy.
And now that Richard's dating,
in solidarity, I think I might get back out there myself.
You make it sound like you've chosen not to date.
Yeah, absolutely. I wanted to focus on Pied Piper.
But, yeah, maybe now I'll fan out my plumage, so to speak,
and see what pretty birdies might share my nest.
Hey, Jared. If you fuck any pretty birdies in my server room,
put a tie on the doorknob, won't you?
Oh, as a signal. Yeah, good thinking.
Okay, so I'll just get the car keys
and then give you a lift home. Okay, my lady?
- My lord. - Oh. My lady.
Okay.
So, Richard tells me you guys are building
deep nets into your platform?
Oh, really? What other company secrets did he blab to you?
Well I'm a bartender,
I wouldn't understand all the science-y talk, right?
- Touche. - So you do AI at Facebook?
No, but when I was at MIT,
I did my master's thesis on game playing AIs.
I did a lot of machine learning stuff.
For gaming? How does that work?
It's on my GitHub. Do you want to check it out?
Gavin said he was gonna haul me into court
and have a judge compel me to give up my source, or go to jail.
Okay? I am not going to jail.
No, no one's going to jail, CJ.
Although, if you did, going to jail for protecting your source
would make you some kind of First Amendment hero.
It's pretty much the best thing that can happen to a journalist.
Journalist? Okay, I'm a tech blogger.
Okay? I write stories for the internet about the internet.
I am not going to jail for that.
I know it is an inconsequential shit job.
It doesn't really contribute to culture in any way whatsoever.
We've established that you don't have any journalistic integrity,
but what would it cost
to buy you some?
Then I figured out a way to
train a convolutional net to play Atari 2600 games.
What?
- Spaces. - Yeah, so what, you guys use tabs?
In this house, yes.
Richard is a bit of a zealot in the Tabs V. Spaces holy war.
I get that, for his company. Sure.
This goes much deeper.
I think he believes that people who use spaces are less than.
I wouldn't mention this to Richard.
You don't want to see him throw a hissy fit.
Okay. Shall we away, my lady?
- Nice to meet you guys. - Have fun.
- Bye. - Bye.
I actually kind of liked her.
Too bad Richard's going to fuck it up.
So, you moved the swimming pool?
Yeah, it just felt like it
was way too far from the house, like, crazy far.
So I had this company come and just move it closer.
But then you moved it back?
Yeah, turns out the guy who
built this place knew exactly what he was doing,
and the pool was right where it needed to be the whole time.
But now I know that for sure, which feels good.
Nelson, do you like being wealthy?
Yeah. Oh, man, it's awesome.
So you want to stay wealthy?
- Okay, yeah, sure. - Great.
Here are the three things you need to do, all right?
One, stop moving the swimming pool.
Oh, yeah, okay, I can do that. What else?
Two, you need to manage your expenses and track your receipts
a little bit better than... this.
I'm only as good as the information I have.
- Oh, you're great. - No, I wasn't fishing for compliments.
And three, I sense that people are taking advantage of you.
Sorry, hold on.
Oh, it's Erlich, I should probably grab this.
Erlich Bachman, a perfect example.
You gave him signing power on your personal checking account?
Yeah, he's my business partner.
You're not structured as a corporation.
You're a general partnership.
So he's essentially your spouse.
- That's very dangerous. - But I trust him.
He's actually trying to save us money right now,
so hold-- hold on.
Hey, man.
Big Head, wondrous news.
I eliminated the Gavin problem, and at the exact same time,
I closed funding on our first strategic investment.
We bought a blog.
Oh, cool. How much do blogs cost?
What? Oh, nothing.
We practically stole it from them.
- What? - I'm bullshitting.
Half a million dollars.
Let me talk to him, please.
Uh, hey, Erlich,
could you talk to, uh,
my business manager for a second.
No, I've got to jet,
but tell him I'll see him at the party.
Good day, partner.
Okay, cool.
About the blog...
- 500 grand. - Oh, God.
I know, we practically stole it, right?
Your roommates are really funny. I like them.
They gave me a little shit.
Oh, well, you can't take that personally.
Oh, it's fine. They gave you shit too.
Oh, really? What about, like my hair or something?
No. They tried to convince me
you were some sort of formatting Nazi
about tabs versus spaces.
What? Me? Nazi?
That's ridiculous.
That's what I said, I mean, I use spaces. So what?
Yeah, so what?
See, they said you'd have a hissy fit if you found out.
Hissy fit, me? No.
- I know. - You know. I know.
I mean, make up your mind, guys,
am I a Nazi or am I a guy who throws hissy fits? You know?
Am I a Nazi who throws hissy fits?
I hope not. That was Hitler. That was like his whole deal.
I mean, that's pretty insensitive
to the Holocaust, don't you think?
Cause that's, like, what Hitler did, you know, he just, like,
killed so many people, so tragic, such a tragic time.
- Yeah. - I'm so glad we're not doing that anymore.
I mean, we, like I... like I was, you know, whoa!
I want them all to die. I don't, I don't care.
I mean, I do care, don't-- don't kill them-- them-- Jews.
Uh, anyway, what do you want to...
what do you want to order here?
Is that our P-to-P protocol?
Yeah, I'm just hacking for fun.
I figured out a way to use our compression for RTC, so...
- Video chat? - Yeah. I think it could be better resolution
than Hooli-Chat. Even over 3G.
It could just be like a fun,
cool feature in the platform, you know.
And then coincidentally you'll finally be able to see
what Elisabet actually looks like.
Oh, yeah.
I hadn't thought of that.
If you worked half as hard on the platform
as you do trying to ogle strange Slavic women,
maybe our shares would finally be worth something.
What the hell was that?
Can you give us slightly more, Richard?
Why did you tell Winnie
that I think people who use spaces over tabs are stupid?
- Because you do. - No, I don't.
And if I did, which I don't,
why would you say that behind my back, to her?
I mean, things were just going so well, until she--
That was completely lovely.
- Yeah, it was really nice. - You're really something.
- I'll give you a call later, okay? - Okay, cool, yeah.
Great, sounds good. Bye, Jared.
Bye.
Jared?
Yeah?
Who was that?
Oh, that was Carol.
So, uh, Jared, did--
did you just have sex with her?
What? I'm an adult,
and like the rest of you, I'm a sexual being.
You fucked her in the garage?
Well, it's the server room and my bedroom.
What, so you just meet a woman,
and then you have sex with her?
How often does this happen?
Well, if you're asking me how many times
I've been in love, the answer is two.
But the rest I won't talk about. It's untoward.
Russ was right, this guy fucks.
Who was that gorgeous gazelle in the driveway?
Well, I've said all I care to, let's move on.
She let Jared have sex with her.
Jared, nice. Using that dick.
Gents, I'd like to invite you
to what promises to be
the social event of the season.
Bachmanity Insanity.
Alcatraz?
Don't worry, it will be unrecognizable.
Jared, with regards to the... you need a plus one?
Oh, no thank you. I think it's too early for that.
Good idea. Don't bring sand to the beach,
there's already pussy there.
Richard, I assume you'll be taking your woman friend?
You know what? Yes. She and I will be there together.
I'm going to make this work,
despite all your little attempts to sabotage my relationship.
You can do anything you put your mind to, Richard.
Including turning Alcatraz into Hawaii.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, all good. Great.
- You know... - What?
My roommate's going out of town tomorrow,
so if we want to come back here after Erlich's party...
Okay, yeah. Sure, that sounds good to me.
- All right, it's a date. - See you then.
Richard, what's wrong?
Nothing. Nothing, literally it's all good.
Come on.
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.
Your roommates were right,
- you really hate spaces. - No, no, no.
I don't, it's not hate, hate's a strong word.
Um, truth be told, I do have a slight preference for tabs.
But that's only because I'm anal and because I prefer...
precision.
Well, not to pick a fight here,
but if you really care about precision, wouldn't you use spaces?
- Nn... - But whatever.
Once it goes through the compiler,
it's the same thing. Right?
Yeah. Yeah, technically yes.
I guess, I just... I just don't understand why you--
anyone would use spaces over tabs.
Like, if it's all the same, why not just use tabs?
Because it could look different on other people's computers.
Tabs create smaller file sizes, all right?
I run a compression company, trust me,
I've devoted my life to minimalizing file sizes.
It's what I do. I mean, I do not get
why anyone would use spaces over tabs.
I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs?
- I do use Vim over Emac. - Oh, God, help us!
Okay, uh... you know what?
I just... I don't think this is going to work. I'm so sorry.
Uh, I mean like, what, we're going to bring kids into this world
with that over their heads?
That's not really fair to them, don't you think?
Kids? We haven't even slept together.
And guess what, it's never going to happen now,
because there is no way I'm going to be with someone
who uses spaces over tabs.
Richard!
Okay. Goodbye.
One tab saves you eight spaces!
Oh, my God!
Richard, what happened?
I just tried to go down the stairs eight steps at a time.
I'm okay, though.
See you around, Richard.
Just making a point.
This new video chat protocol is making your image crystal clear.
Wait... wait one second, Dinesh.
Uh, Dinesh, I can't see you, it's all black.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't give the camera permission
to access the video chat, hold on.
- Boom! - Yes! I can... see you now.
It's me! Pakistani Denzel!
Yes! The Denzel who is from Pakistan.
This video quality is great, right? Looks so sharp.
That's what we do here at Pied Piper.
It-- it's very impressive.
Um, I will have to tell my boyfriend all about it.
Boyfriend? You never mentioned a boyfriend.
Oh, no?
This is because he's now just husband.
Um, I keep forgetting to say this, husband,
but it is very good to see you this way,
and we will talk more tomorrow.
Yeah, we'll talk--
Either she froze time,
met and married the man of her dreams,
unfroze time, and hopped back on to vid chat with you,
or... you're the dogface.
Which do you think it is? I'm on the fence.
What the fuck is going on? Richard found a girl,
you have a girlfriend, Jared is getting laid with a girl.
Hi, Mom.
Oh, God. Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.
Sweet, sweet Elisabet.
Gentlemen, mahalo for coming.
You must taste the breaded humuhumunukunukuapua'a,
flown in fresh this A.M.
- What is mumu-- - It's breaded.
Get ready. In T-minus five minutes,
Big Head and I are going to take that stage
and I am going to ejaculate my success all over the faces
and hair of my fiercest rivals.
Like some sort of vengeful viscous web of payback.
- Erlich? - Yes. One moment.
Sasha, you are doing an exceptional job. I mean,
I see... I see no evidence that we are not in Hawaii.
Hm... we have a problem.
Just several of our vendors
are saying that your checks have bounced.
Um, Sasha... I'll be back.
Big Head, Big Head. Why are our checks bouncing?
If you had responded to any of my phone calls,
I would've explained it to you.
Who the fuck are you?
Uh, Erlich this is my business manager, Arthur...
- Klaiman. - Klaiman. I knew it was something with Clay.
As I was explaining to Mr. Bighetti,
I've finally managed to get a handle on his finances.
Our finances. Continue.
After your considerable outlay on lifestyle,
this party and half a million dollars on a website,
you're functionally insolvent.
Big Head, you're broke?
We're broke, dude.
Erlich, it's time.
You have my number. I left it on your voicemail.
Several times.
Titans of the tech world,
I give you Nelson Bighetti, Erlich Bachman,
and Bachmanity!
Aloha.
Uh, that means hello.
Oh, and goodbye.
Shit. I... I swear I deleted a picture,
but when I clicked back to the album,
the icon reappeared. It undeleted itself.
But I can't get it to happen again, so...
Hey, Richard, totally out of the blue,
do you know how we might be able to find that bug?
No, Dinesh. We are not releasing the beta.
We integrated the neural net a week ago.
The platform is full of bugs.
But that is what a beta is for.
You give it to people in the real world, they use it,
and that is how we find the bugs.
Richard, Reid Hoffman says if you're not mortally embarrassed
by the quality of your initial release, you've released too late.
Okay. We already are mortally embarrassed.
Okay? We move in and subsequently out of our offices,
mainly because it was too expensive,
we fired two CEOs, we've pivoted to a box, and then pivoted back.
Any more bad word of mouth and we will be royally fucked.
Where's Gilfoyle?
Hey, Gilfoyle, the deletion issue is ducking me again,
and... and, um, I'm sorry.
- Oh, hey, Richard. - Hi, Tara.
I need to borrow your fella here for a second.
All right, babe, I gotta go.
Hey, when you check out the settings view,
can you let me know if there's something weird
that happens with the submit button?
It was a little weird when I was doing QA.
Yeah, okay. Sorry, the... the settings view for...?
The beta.
- The beta for...? - Pied Piper.
It's a promising compression company that doesn't pay very well.
- You sent her the beta? - I did.
Are you fucking insane? It's not ready.
It's riddled with bugs.
Really? Cause I've been test driving it all day,
and it's pretty fucking awesome.
- Really? You think so? - Yeah. For real.
Congratulations, Richard. It's so fucking cool.
And when the neural net kicks in, it's gonna be rad.
But, you know, I did have one problem, though.
I tried to restore an old file
and it asked me to confirm twice.
Yeah, well, that was a bad merge.
It's been there for months. I fixed it in ten seconds.
Richard...
Maybe.
Yeah, maybe beta.
- Hi, Dinesh. - Tara.
Wait, that can't be right.
How can Bachmanity still be so far in the hole?
Look at all this shit that Big Head is selling.
He was renting virtually everything in the house.
He rented that cannon?
It was for display purposes only. So you forfeit your deposit.
It's a cannon. What's he supposed to do, not fire it?
That was the provision.
So that's it then, I guess.
Big Head's really broke.
You know what? He's young. He'll get past it.
Nelson is not the only one who should be worried.
You were partners.
Fair point. But shuttering a company in the tech world
is almost a rite of passage, like herpes simplex one.
At first, it's ugly and embarrassing
and you're disgusted by your own dick.
But after a while,
in the larger scheme of things, you realize it's really--
Mr. Bachmann, you structured Bachmanity as a general partnership.
Then, with no money in the bank,
you threw a million-dollar luau on Alcatraz.
You're on the hook for that.
And even declaring bankruptcy
isn't going to absolve you of these debts.
- Bankruptcy? - It's none of my business. Good luck.
Wait, where are you going?
We need you. You're our business manager.
There's no business remaining to manage.
Good day, Mr. Bachmann.
Hey, good news. They said we can each keep
one of the cannonballs, so not a total loss, right?
All right, so I've set up a sign-up page for the beta,
and we're gonna keep it small and secure,
so that means we're limited to ten invite codes each to send out.
I've already got my list.
It's people that I know personally,
and, uh, people that I know I can trust.
We only get ten each. This could be prickly.
Well, I'm out. I don't trust anyone.
It's a huge part of my belief system.
You sent the beta to Tara.
Yeah, there was a transactional nature to that exchange
- which I'll get into if you want. - Pass.
But it doesn't mean that I trust her,
and I certainly don't trust anyone else.
Oh, in other words, you have no friends.
On principle. I could make what rises
to your low standards of a friend any time I want.
Sure you could.
Gilfoyle, if you're not gonna use your ten invites,
- could Dinesh and I have them? - Sure. Knock yourselves out.
Loser. He's got no friends.
Okay... Miriam, Sylvia...
Oh, Samantha! I almost forgot her.
You know, Jared, you can have all ten of Gilfoyle's invites.
- Much appreciated. - Yeah.
Monica, hello.
Did you honestly think that you could send me an email
telling me that you were
launching the beta without sending me the beta?
Come on. I'm dying to see it.
Well, I think the whole point of it, Monica, is to get
the beta into the hands of unbiased people
so they can give us an honest... feedback.
Besides, I... I just gave out my ten invites.
Oh, if Monica wants an invite,
I could, like, squeeze her on my list.
- Are you sure? - Yeah, no problem.
Okay, Monica, well, you're in luck.
Dinesh has decided to give you one of his codes, so...
Great. I promise I'll find something terrible to say.
Okay, so I did a rough accounting
of your assets and liabilities.
Jared, don't look at me like that. Just give it to me straight.
All right. Your house has appreciated
in value since you bought it, but if you sold it now
for what Zillow and Redfin think it's worth...
I'd still be half a million in the hole.
Now, that's the bad news.
- Is there good news? - Well, it's unclear.
I... I went back through your records.
Uh, at first, I'll admit a bit voyeuristically,
uh, to see where all of the money went,
and apart from the party expenses,
- which were staggering... - Yeah. Fuck, yeah.
But one number jumped out at me.
Now, whoever did your accounting earmarked almost 70 percent
of Big Head's settlement money for taxes.
Seventy percent?
Even in Taxo-Alto, which I coined,
would be half that. Where did that money go?
Well, that is the six-million-dollar question.
I may have the answer.
I'm sorry. You're accusing me of impropriety?
You, the man who spent $20,000
renting giant fiberglass tiki heads,
and $40,000 more when one of them was misplaced
on the way back to the rental house?
I told you it wasn't misplaced. I know exactly where it is.
It's at the bottom of the bay.
I called you a thief because you, sir, have stolen from us.
Nelson, come on. You can't possibly believe this.
- Sorry. - Don't apologize to him.
- Oh, right. Sorry. - Thank you.
Arthur, you listen to me, and you listen good.
I have people calling me 40 times a day asking for their money.
I even considered selling my house to pay them.
So you are going to go in your little fucking piggy bank
right now and pay back every fucking kopeck
that you stole from Big Head, and if you don't,
we're gonna take our little show on the road,
perhaps perform it for a man named the D.A.
Ridiculous.
Very well.
Game on.
Let's go, Big Head.
Wait.
I may have moved around some of your money in a way
that wasn't exactly conventional.
- Give me back Big Head's fucking money! - Yeah!
- Sorry. Sorry. - No, you did good.
I can't, because I don't have it.
Hey, Marc, we may have a problem.
What's up? Well, a buddy of mine at Datatrode sits next to a guy
who just got invited to Pied Piper's beta.
Shit. They're already in beta?
Should I tell Gavin? Fuck no.
We're still two or three months out.
Yeah, if he hears Pied Piper's already in beta,
trust me, he'll lose his shit.
Fine. But if it ever comes up, I didn't hear about this.
- And this came in when? - 43 minutes ago.
And deleted six minutes after that.
Fortunately, the filters, which I had installed, sir,
caught the relevant keywords.
I decided to walk it to you personally.
An employee's withholding
critical information about a competitor.
This is a fireable offense.
You want me to bring this guy in?
No.
Acting on this would expose the fact
that we're reading employees' private emails,
destroying the spirit of trust and freedom to innovate
that I've worked so hard to build here at Hooli.
You know, it makes you wonder if the word Hooli
has any meaning for these people whatsoever.
- Is there anything I can do? - Yeah.
Get me a look at that Pied Piper beta.
I will figure out a way, sir.
Finally. Where the fuck have you--
- Hey, thanks for the lift, Kevin. - Yeah, no worries.
Oh, Kevin, this is Dinesh, one of my coworkers.
Dinesh, this is Kevin. We met at Phil's Coffee.
- We're friends now. Isn't that right, Kevin? - Yeah.
All right, my friend. I should get to work,
- so thanks for the lift. - Yeah.
Thanks for the coffees.
Catch ya later, my friend.
That was my friend, Kevin.
Congratulations. You now have one friend.
He also said there was a bug on the landing page.
- Well, how severe is it? - Not bad.
Compared to the rest of what he said, it's nothing.
Guys, uh, you might as well hear this from me.
I just had a long talk
about the beta with my friend, Todd Chambers.
The Dropbox guy?
Yeah, he was employee number 11.
Why did you send it to him? He hates everything.
Well, because I thought he would be honest with me,
and, um, and he was. Quite honest.
He said that in the 15 years he's been working in the Valley,
our beta was the best beta he's ever seen.
- By far. - What? Really?
I don't want to count our chickens before they hatch.
I mean, three percent of hatchlings are born mutated or dead,
but we may have a healthy brood on our hands.
I'm getting the same reaction.
I mean, a few bugs here and there,
but overall, they love it.
We might be holding pocket aces here.
Awesome.
Hey, guys.
- How you holding up? - Good, yeah.
I mean, just trying to make sense of all the feedback.
Well, you know, I guess you just can't let it get in your head.
- Don't you mean go to my head? - What did I say?
You said, get in your head, like it's,
like it's a bad thing, but it's not.
- It's great. People love it. - Really?
Yeah. Yeah. I can't believe it myself.
- They're flipping out. - That's awesome. That...
And that's... that's for the beta that you sent me?
No, Monica. It's for the other beta
that we've got kicking around here.
I mean, I... I... I have an inbox full of raves here for the...
upload performance, the mobile, the--
What about... what about the interface?
Did people have any issues with that?
No, not at all. Why? Do...
Do you have any issues with the interface?
I... I haven't actually had a chance to look at it yet.
Are you serious? You've been sitting on the beta for a day
after busting my balls about not getting an invite.
- Pretty fuckin' lame. - Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah. Lame.
I just got an email from my friend, Max Karnow.
He says, I heard the beta's awesome. Can I get a look?
Guys, I think we're starting to get some buzz.
You know, maybe we should talk
to Laurie about moving up the official launch?
- You want to move it up? - Yeah, I think we're ready.
I mean, do-- do you think you can set the meeting?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll... I'll go tell Laurie right now.
Okay.
What was that about?
She's fucking weird.
Hey, Richard, um, if your friend Max Karnow
needs an invite, you know, I could probably
- squeeze him on my list. - Are you sure?
Yeah. I'll have to freeze out one of my boys,
but they'll get it.
Just shoot me his email.
The perpetrator has been
losing money for other clients for years,
was lying to us and funneling our money to said other clients,
therein, fucking us.
I'm sorry to say this is not an uncommon occurrence.
Wait, it's not an uncommon...? So then it--
Okay, got it.
So if it makes any difference,
I'd like to vie for a lesser sentence
if after he makes full restitution he would write
a very convincing public apology, preferably--
Mr. Bachmann,
an action like this is very expensive and time-consuming,
and as you've already pointed out, even if you do prevail,
the money is gone, unless you win a court order
allowing you to raid other innocent people's bank accounts,
and that's a tough sell,
even for a plaintiff who's more, uh, sympathetic.
Are you calling us unsympathetic?
You just threw a million-dollar party.
A tasteful Polynesian affair, culturally accurate,
which I'm sure you would appreciate,
and one that we can no longer pay for
because this criminal has left us flat broke.
Also not true. You have a large stake
in a company called Pied Piper.
Yes, but I... I can't sell my shares
at Pied Piper. Not now.
Wouldn't it cover your outstanding debts?
Of course. But they could potentially be worth billions.
Yes, and how do you see
that playing to people who are being priced out
of their homes by rich tech people?
Have either of you been on a jury?
No, of course not. I always get out of it.
The fines are very reasonable.
You don't just throw those things away?
Gentlemen, let me tell you what I see.
I see two able-bodied, entitled young white men
who lucked into more money
than most people see in five lifetimes,
and who, if they hadn't had their millions stolen,
would have promptly squandered them on more things like
relocated swimming pools and lost tiki heads.
It's not lost.
I know exactly where it is. It's in the bay.
And if your Coast Guard would be a little more helpful,
we probably could have dragged it out of there by now.
Mr. Bachmann,
you pay those caterers and bartenders you owe money to
or I assure you, that, I will prosecute.
Mr. Chugtai, I am gonna need
all the phone numbers of the people on your list.
Why?
I'm just calling everybody that was on the beta and saying hi
and a quick thank you, and then a...
just a couple of follow-up questions.
Yeah... I don't think so.
What do... what do you mean?
Well, I mean, put yourself in their shoes.
They're, like, snowboarding in Tahoe
or, like, banging some smokin' chick,
and then this fuckin' nerd calls
and he wants to talk about his app.
- Buzz-kill. - Wait. Your boys are where?
Well, those are just hypotheticals.
I mean, my boys could be anywhere. I don't keep track of my boys.
Actually, we can.
We have the IP address and GPS coordinates for every active user,
so we can figure out just where your boys are at.
Um, you added a god-view? When did you do that?
Right before I gave it to Tara. I told you, trust no one.
Oh, that is very cool. Nice work, Gilfoyle.
And we can isolate each of our users.
Dinesh's, for example...
Before we invade people's privacy,
there is a conversation about ethics.
Why is it that five of your users show up at this address?
Oh, it's buggy.
Should we beta test the god-view?
I'm happy to drag this out as long as you want to.
Fine.
I was having trouble filling up my list,
so I made up a few people.
Well, people do create
imaginary friends to meet their emotional needs.
When I was little,
I used to pretend that I shared a room with Harriet Tubman
and we were always planning our big escape.
Wait. Who is this,
and why are they at the Hooli campus?
What? Did you give the beta to someone at fucking Hooli?
- Who's Max Karnow? - Oh! That's not one of my friends.
I have no friends. Got him from Richard.
No. No, th-- that can't be right.
I went to Hendricks' Facebook page.
I found a friend of his that lived near Palo Alto,
searched his name and found that he was in the tech business.
I then came up with a great idea to dummy up
an email account in his name,
sent a beta request to Hendricks, and then voila.
- That's incredible. - Yes, well, it is my craft.
You see, I think security detail
is like creating great jazz where you can all--
What are you talk-- I'm talking about the beta.
Will you shut the fuck up?!
Fuck, this is good.
Their sign-up flow, their mobile app, it's just seamless.
How are they doing this?!
I can put a team on that, sir.
If you want to know how they--
Why are you so high-maintenance?
- Do you want me to answer that, sir? - No! Goddamn it!
You're so needy!
Okay, I just talked to the real Max Karnow,
and he had no idea about the beta.
Wow, um, clearly we're dealing with a Hooli spy here.
So what do we do?
I mean, shut down his account, obviously.
Yeah. On it. Sorry, Dinesh.
You will now have one less fake friend.
Wait, Gilfoyle. Is shutting down this guy's account
really the worst thing we can think of to do to him?
Oh, my God. Where the fuck is my head?
Stand by.
Look at their compression ratios.
The more files uploaded, the better they get?
- Are we doing that? - No. Not really.
That's gotta be some kind of machine learning optimization.
- Maybe a neural net? - Well, then I want that.
You need to put that into our platform. Now.
I'm not even sure we have the resources here
to engineer something like that.
And even if we did,
our platform isn't designed to accommodate it.
You're talking about a ground-up rebuild.
Great. So do that. And beat them to market.
That's impossible.
You're at Hooli now, Marc.
In case you didn't know, here at Hooli,
we make the impossible possible.
So if I say I need...
- What the fuck is happening? - Oh, shit!
It looks like a zip bomb. They must know it's us.
- That hard drive is fucked. - This is my personal laptop.
You opened a stolen beta on your personal computer?
Yes. And I installed it on my phone.
Shit. It could fry the entire system.
- Cut the power to the building! - No, Gavin.
It's isolated to your user account,
so it's just your laptop and your phone.
It has no impact on the rest of the network.
You don't know that. You don't know shit. None of you do!
You don't even know what Hendricks is capable of.
Cut the power to the building! Cut the power to the building!
And that's that.
- And now... delete user. - Nice.
Wait, is that-- is that Monica? She finally opened it.
Oh, yeah. Well, that's odd.
It says here that she started using it yesterday.
Wait, so she lied? Why would she lie about using the beta?
Yeah, why would Dinesh lie about having friends?
Why would Tara lie to me about fucking other guys
when we have a totally open and hedonistic relationship
that allows for behavior like that?
Because people like to lie, Richard.
It's a war of all against all.
The history of humanity is a book written in blood.
We're all just animals in a pit.
- I feel very sad. - Fucking Gilfoyle.
No, no. What are you doing? Get back to work.
On what? You powered down all the computers.
Use a notepad. Code on your phone. We have a deadline here.
No, Gavin, you have a deadline.
We quit, like we should have done the first time.
What first time? What are you talking about?
We both worked at Nucleus right here in this room.
Yeah, before you fired us and rehired us
to do the exact same thing without ever noticing.
I invited you to my wedding, Gavin.
Why?
We just lost our key engineers.
What the hell do we do now?
No one leaves this room
until we figure it out.
Thanks for the lift.
Steve's place is pretty far away from everything,
but he's letting me stay on his couch for free, so...
And you were supposed to be my meal ticket.
Yeah.
Hold on. CJ called.
Hey, uh, just wanted to let you know
about a great new story I'm chasing.
It's a cautionary tale of two young entrepreneurs
who flew too close to the sun.
I mean, apparently in the midst of losing millions,
they threw a huge party they couldn't afford.
I talked to two bartenders and a caterer
who worked your party the other night.
None of them have been paid. Call me.
Well, it appears we spent our last dime acquiring a tech blog
whose chief focus is chronicling our demise.
And Jian-Yang...
Erlich Bachmann, is your refrigerator running?
This is Mike Hunt.
Oh, here, here it is on the right.
Thanks, man. Hey, uh, are you sure you're cool
with me taking both cannonballs?
- I'm sure. - Thanks, partner.
I got it.
I know you lied.
- Sorry. - What the fuck?
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
How the hell did you know that I was here?
Well, we have god-view on the beta,
and I saw you leave your office and come here.
So you're stalking me?
Look, Monica, I know you're lying about not using the beta,
so why haven't I heard from you?
- Richard... - No, it's okay.
If you don't like it, you can say it.
Everybody loves it, so I think I can handle one negative review.
- Fine. I don't like it. - Really?
Are you serious? Everybody else loves it.
I've never wanted to like something more in my life, Richard.
- I just... I don't. - Okay.
What specifically do you not like about it?
Specifically?
All of it.
I mean, it's not, it's not the UX or the design
or anything that you can tweak.
It's just the whole thing feels engineered.
Okay. Well, that might make sense because, um, I'm an engineer.
Look, you've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback.
The build is incredibly stable, and you're out of money.
So if you think it's ready,
you should launch and unlock the next three million.
Look, Monica, I... I value your opinion,
and you're the one that doesn't like it,
so I don't know.
Richard, look...
- I passed on Slack. - Really?
I never told Laurie. She'd probably fire me
if she knew, but I had a chance to buy
20 percent of Slack for nothing, and I passed.
I didn't get it. I still don't.
I mean, what is it? Is it email? Is it a chat room?
Turns out the answer is it's a three billion dollar company.
But that's the fucked up thing about what we do.
Sometimes our opinion is wrong.
And no matter how good something is,
there's always gonna be someone who doesn't get it.
And unfortunately, with Pied Piper, it's me.
Um, a week ago,
I was worried about releasing a beta no one would like.
I'm just bummed that you're the one that doesn't like it.
Which is why you can't listen to anyone else.
If you believe in something,
don't let anyone talk you out of it, including me.
Peter Gregory always said,
Don't invest in products; invest in people.
I invested in you,
and if you think it's ready to go,
I will go to Laurie and fight like hell for it.
So, what do you want to do?
Congratulations, everyone.
Yeah, I can't believe it.
We're actually, finally, launching.
Yes. Tuesday, 9:00 A.M.
Pats on the back. Pats on the back.
Gentlemen, I just realized I've forgotten to take a shit.
So, uh, I'll see you back at the old homestead.
Okay.
Laurie.
I have a business proposition I'd like to discuss with you.
It's about my shares in Pied Piper.
Okay, T minus five minutes.
Dinesh, are you still seriously squashing bugs?
Not really. I'm so fucking tired,
I'm creating more than I'm fixing.
Where the fuck is Gilfoyle?
This isn't easy for me to do.
You served me well, old friend.
But we're transferring to AWS now,
and I'm afraid you can't come.
Oh, I'm pathetic?
I'd rather have a bunch of fake friends
than be best friends with a fucking metal box.
Can't you two see?
You're each other's best friends.
Fuck you, Jared.
Yeah. Jinx.
You owe each other a friendship.
One minute. Holy shit.
Holy shit.
Excuse me.
- Hello? - Hey, it's CJ.
Uh, I just heard from the folks that worked your party.
- And? - And it turns out they were paid in full.
So apparently I owe you an apology, and I feel bad.
Not as bad as I feel, I can assure you.
Yeah, I'm getting another call.
Hello?
Erlich Bachmann,
this is your mom,
and you are not my baby.
Not now, Jian-Yang! Not now! Go back into your room!
- Sorry. - It's okay.
Here we are, Erlich.
Jobs and Woz, Woz and Jobs.
I mean, we did it. You and me, man, forever.
All right.
Richard, never been more excited to be proven wrong.
Yeah, well, get ready for your lives to change forever.
Five...
...four, three, two, one.
From "Bloomberg West" in San Francisco,
I'm Emily Chang.
General Keith Alexander is here
to tackle tech's role in counter-terrorism,
but first, a quick glimpse with Richard Hendricks,
founder and CEO
of the hot new compression platform Pied Piper,
and Erlich Bachman, Chief Visionary.
Oh, Emily Chang,
it is just splendid to be here with you,
at historical Pier Three, with a breathtaking view
of the Embarcadero Center
and the flag of San Francisco.
Now, Richard...
Richard actually developed
this technology in my incubator.
I am listed-- I was originally listed
under the white pages as "Erlich Blachman,"
uh, with an "L," A typo that apparently couldn't be changed,
and then Google indexed it, so I've been dealing with that.
Richard, Pied Piper has taken off like a rocket.
More than a hundred thousand installs
in just ten days. Is that right?
Yes.
Pretty amazing.
And you have a last-minute invite
to the "Vanity Fair" Summit dinner tonight.
Quite an honor for such a young company.
Richard, maybe you can comment on this one?
Yeah, we are the-- finally the-- the belles of the balls.
I mean, uh, ball.
Now, some people are calling you the next unicorn.
Have you guys thought about that?
You could have a billion-dollar company.
Erlich, you could own five percent of a billion dollars.
Uh, ten, actually.
Richard, this is boring.
- Shit. - No, no, no.
He was-- he was an early investor.
Again, it's... Erlich Bachman.
If you Google that,
it'll say, "Did you mean Erlich Blachman?"
You can click on that link,
it'll give you the correct results for Erlich Bachman.
Should we take some calls?
We don't do that here.
I just know what I saw, Richard.
No, come on. Look, she's married, she just had another baby.
If you pushed a little harder,
you could have scored right there on camera.
- You should get her phone number. - Shut up.
Oh. This is actually, uh, Jian-Yang pranking me.
I should take it.
Yes, of course I have frog's legs. Why do you ask?
Are you serious? Have you honestly
still not told him that you sold your shares?
You can't keep lying to him like this.
It's not technically a lie.
My shares don't transfer to Raviga
until the next board meeting.
Come on, it's been ten days.
I know, I know, but, you know, the TechCrunch thing
came up and then there was the Reddit AMA
and, you know, now this Bloomberg thing.
And besides, let's be honest,
Richard shouldn't be in the public eye
without me along to help.
Did you see the skeeved-out look on Emily Chang's face?
I thought she was going to walk off set.
Erlich, you're lying to him,
and you made me a part of it, so now I'm lying to him, too.
The longer you wait, the worse this is gonna get.
- All right, fine, I'll tell him. - When?
After the "Vanity Fair" thing tonight.
I mean, did you see the guest list?
Monica, throw me a bone here.
24 hours, then I'm telling him.
- Fine, I'll tell him. I'll tell Richard. - I'm serious.
- Tell me what? - I'm not joking--
it was, uh, Jian-Yang.
He said to tell you that Phillip McCrevis left word.
Oh, who's "Fill-up My--" Oh.
Richard, we'd better get our asses in first fucking gear
if we want to make it to this "Verge" Photoshoot.
Oh, shit. That's today?
Yes, I assumed that's why you're still
wearing your Bloomberg makeup.
No. No, I was just-- I kind of like the way it--
can we just push this to next week, please?
They don't really do that.
Okay, well, can you go?
Please? I just have a ton of work,
and honestly I would be really happy
if I never had to do any of this ever again
and then you were just the face of the company.
You know what I mean? Oh, shit.
What-- what time is this "Vanity Fair" thing?
It's tonight. I figure we're wheels up by 6:00,
then we can check into the hotel, shit, shave and shit again.
- Get a cocktail. - What hotel?
Eavesdropping. Well, if you must know,
we got a suite at the Fairmont, and they're sending a car.
I think Richard deserves it.
And then I figured tomorrow in the a.m.,
we would sleep in and have a nice brunch.
I don't have time for a brunch. I have to be back here.
Come on, eggs benny, a little spinach tartar,
you'll flirt with the waitress.
- Killer. - And, uh, we'll have a nice talk.
Talk? What about?
You know, things, all sorts of themes.
So tomorrow, you, me, brunch
and, uh, one word: frittata.
Hey, fellas, is it me or is it a bit chilly in here?
What in God's name is that?
What do you think it is? It's a jacket!
Now, I only ordered one as a sample,
but once I have your sizes, we can all have them.
Why would we all want them? One is already too many.
I don't mean in the house. I mean, like, in the world.
Now Gilfoyle, I have you at about a 40 long? Am I right?
If my mother was naked and dead in the street,
I would not cover her body with that jacket.
Gilf.
Jared, now that you're here,
we need two new tables in the game room.
Okay. Well, maybe against the doors?
Oh, hold on, there's more.
"Pied Piper: Because 'awesome world-changing compression company'
would take up too much space."
And you guys give me shit for a tiny gold chain?
I regret nothing. I'm going to get coffee.
Hey, Brownie, you coming?
I was thinking we'd hit the Philz on Middlefield.
No, let's drive to the one on Forest Avenue.
It's further from that jacket.
Claude, you're on pager duty until we get back.
Jared, can I borrow that jacket?
I sense you're doing something ironic with it,
but I'm okay with that because...
however unattractive this jacket may seem to you,
once you slip it on, everything will change.
It'll shake out its hair and take off its glasses,
and before you know it, you'll be in love.
Jared, it's really fucking ugly.
Consider the tortoise.
As the fable teaches us,
it may appear that he is losing in his race
against his nemesis, the insolent and cocksure hare.
But appearances can be deceiving.
Gavin, the tortoise. Is it Endframe?
Yes. But there's more.
- The hare is Pied Piper. - Indeed it is. Someone's read their Aesop.
We've also read the financials, Gavin.
Between Nucleus and Endframe, you've burned through
three-quarters of a billion dollars,
with virtually nothing to show for it.
Two weeks ago, on the heels of powering down
the entire Hooli campus for seemingly no reason,
you lost all of Endframe's senior engineers.
I grant you, we've stumbled on offense of late,
but the best offense is a good defense.
We've taken a page out of Apple's playbook
and are currently "Reviewing" The Pied Piper app for sale
in our Hooli store at a pace one might call "Tortoise-like."
Don't. They hate that.
In any case, I have it on good authority
that it may be some time before Pied Piper
is available on Hooli OS devices.
- We're making it available immediately. - Sorry?
You're fighting a war that's already ended, Gavin.
Pied Piper won.
We called this board meeting
to inform you that it's time for Hooli to let go
and move on without you at the wheel.
I'm sorry, without me? Are you firing me?
Our intention is simply to transition you
into a more appropriate role within the company,
one with less oversight of day-to-day operations.
You're putting me on the fucking roof?
You could always choose to move on, Gavin. Up to you.
I built this company with my bare hands in my fucking garage.
Where were you when I was doing that?
Gavin?
These animals?
Fuck.
Well, uh, you are certainly
more than qualified to be our new head of PR.
Laurie thinks you're great.
to be honest, we could use the help.
All the media stuff has
been pretty overwhelming, especially lately.
If Marissa Mayer can do it, so can you.
And, uh, you're available immediately?
I am. I do have one question for you guys.
Is everything here... cool?
Is it cool? Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I'm-- I'm cool.
Yeah, he is cool.
Clearly, but is there anything you guys want to tell me...
about the company?
What, like, uh--
All right, look, this is weird,
but when I was in Laurie's office yesterday,
I saw a piece of paper on her desk.
Well, she-- she can be a bit untidy.
It was a sale of a big block of Pied Piper stock.
Is someone on the inside
- dumping shares right as you're launching? - What?
No. No, absolutely not.
'Cause that would be a pretty severe signaling risk.
I mean, you don't have to be in PR to know that insiders
only dump stock like that when they know something is wrong.
The bulk of my compensation here would be options,
and if those aren't going to be worth anything--
Yeah. No. No, no, no.
That is not happening, okay? Nothing is going on here.
- Yeah, except excellence. - Okay.
Well, you let me know what you want to do
and I'll think about it.
Okay.
Um, well, thanks for coming.
What the hell was that?
Maybe it was a negotiating tactic?
Monica.
It's Monica.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.
I mean, she's the only one who's bought a jacket.
Jared, she's the only one who hates the platform.
There's no other explanation for this. Okay? Monica fucked us.
She pulled down her pants and fucked us in front of her parents.
Did some-- Richard, did somebody do that to you?
No. No, I don't know why--
Oh, boy, it is chilly.
Good thing I brought this sweet jiz-acket.
Eh, friend? We came here together.
I know what you're doing.
You think you're embarrassing me,
but that's only the secondary effect of that shitty jacket.
The primary effect is...
that you look like a douchebag.
Let me put this in terms you'll understand.
I'm like a suicide bomber of humiliation.
I'm happy to go out as long as I take you with me.
Your shame is my paradise.
S'up, ladies?
What you noshing on? Cranberry scone?
My friend Dinesh here
has a little crush on you. He's shy.
I don't know him.
Oh, he plays coy.
I don't know why he's so shy.
Excuse me. I noticed your jacket.
Do you work for Pied Piper?
- Yeah. - Dude, your app is killin' it.
Everyone I know is installing it.
Do you seriously? I just downloaded it last night.
- Yeah? - Do you mind if we get a picture?
- With me? - Yeah. Everybody get in.
If you want it.
- Thanks. - Thanks, bro.
Hey, man, did you remember to put money in the meter?
Hi, I'm Dinesh. I work at Pied Piper.
Excuse me, do I know you?
Gilfoyle.
He's a fuckin' dick, but I love him, though.
You have me confused with someone else.
My name's clearly Jared,
and if you would excuse us, you were interrupting.
No, he's lying. His name is Gilfoyle.
Show them your driver's license.
Jared asked you nicely to step back,
so step the fuck back. You're being a dick,
and you're cutting in line.
You heard him. You're being a dick.
- Boy, some people. - What a creep.
Sorry you had to deal with that, Jared.
You and me both, friend.
This is Monica.
Is it? Because apparently everything else
that comes out of your mouth is a lie.
Shit.
Look, Richard, I totally understand if you're pissed at me,
but please know that I tried
as hard as I could to get him to tell you.
Oh, really? Well, that's not what he said.
Oh, really? What exactly did he say?
He said that he found it on a piece of paper in Laurie's office.
What? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
Who's the "he" That you're talking about?
You know who. David.
My brother?
What? Who the fuck-- I don't know.
No, David, the fucking PR guy
who's not going to take a job with us because of what you did.
Richard, I am totally lost. What exactly do you think I did?
You can play dumb all you want to. It won't change the one thing
that both you and I know is true. You dumped your stock.
What? No. I didn't dump a single share of my Pied Piper stock.
- I swear. - Well, then who the fuck did?
And make sure that the money reads.
I mean, Pied Piper is a billion-dollar company.
It's not just a unicorn.
All right, let's do some rearing.
There we go. Now, let's let the horns
sort of look like my dick. Perfect.
- Are you fucking kidding me? - Richard.
Can we take a soft five?
I was going to tell you. That's what tomorrow's brunch was for.
Brunch? You had ten fucking days and you didn't say a thing.
Fine. You want to know why I didn't tell you?
Because it's fucking humiliating. I'm broke, Richard.
Did you hear me? I'm broke.
Erlich Bachman, the name that used to be synonymous with success,
went broke and was forced to sell.
- I got royally fucked, Richard. - You got fucked?
You're the one who threw a million-dollar party.
- Yeah, but it was a great party. - No one forced you to do that.
Admit it, you fucked yourself.
But I'm not gonna let you fuck my company.
I'm going to have to issue a press release
explaining what you did and why.
No, no, come on. This isn't out.
- It's one PR guy. - That we know of, Erlich.
How many other people saw that piece of paper?
How many people has this guy talked to?
This is Silicon Valley.
Rumors spread like light speed here.
How are we gonna get good people to work for us
if they think something funky is going on with our stock?
How are we going to scale? This is going to kill us.
Richard, do you know what happens if this goes public?
- I'm Ron Wayne. - Who?
Ron Wayne.
The guy that owned ten percent of Apple and sold it in 1976.
No one in this town will work with me ever again.
You want me to risk the entire future of Pied Piper,
everything that I've worked for,
just to protect you from your own fucking incompetence?
Richard, there's a three to four percent chance
that this is going to get out on its own,
but there is 100 percent chance
that if you issue a press release
no one will ever take me seriously again.
My dignity is in your hands, Richard.
Do with it what you will.
Gavin? Is that you?
Jack Barker. Nice plane.
Yours too. Where are you headed?
I just needed to take a walk and clear my head.
There's this great little hiking trail
near my lodge in Jackson Hole.
Get out of here. I'm on my way up to J Hole myself.
Is that right? I thought you sold.
No, I just never go there.
So how long you going for?
Coming back tomorrow afternoon.
- Me, too. - Oh, come on. Come on.
Seriously, we need to find a couple hours,
get together, catch up.
I could tell you some war stories.
Well, I'd love that.
I could tell you a few of my own.
Well, be well.
- You, too. - Take care, Jack.
Yeah. See you.
Gavin? Wait.
What are we doing here?
I mean, you're on your way to Jackson Hole,
I'm going to Jackson Hole.
You seem like you could use some company.
- You play chess? - I do. Indeed.
Fantastic. I tell you, when we get up to altitude
and the Wi-Fi kicks in,
I'm ActionJB62 on Hooli chat.
- Find me. - I will.
- I'm glad we bumped into each other. - Me, too.
- Really is a small world. - It's crazy.
Okay, well, uh, I think it reads well.
And it's all in there.
This will definitely set the record straight.
Then again, you're basically lighting Erlich on fire.
So what? He fucked the company.
He potentially fucked the company.
Are you kidding me? Wh-- Gilfoyle, back me up here.
This is thorny.
How is this even a question for you guys?
Honestly?
I mean, it's not like he's going to be out on the street.
He just sold ten percent of a company
that's valued at at least 50 million dollars
and now suddenly we're giving him the benefit of the doubt?
Well, it sounds mighty Christian of you, Gilfoyle.
There's no reason for hate speech, Richard.
I can see by the sour, pinched expressions
on all your faces that Richard has filled you in
regarding the unfortunate circumstances that have forced me
to relinquish my stake in your fair company.
Erlich, uh, you should know that I have written a press release.
- Oh? - I'm not going to release it yet,
but if I hear wind of these rumors
spreading out of control,
I'm going to send it to every tech publication
and blog on the face of the earth. Do you understand?
- Even UPROXX? - Yes, even them.
Also, uh...
this is the check
for next month's use of the house as our office,
but we'll be out by the end of the month.
Richard, it doesn't have to be like this.
From this point forward,
you will have nothing to do with this company whatsoever.
I'm replacing you on the board,
and I'm giving your seat to Jared.
- So that's it then. - Yes.
So I guess we better get ready for that "Vanity Fair" Event.
What?
Did you not listen to a word I just said?
I heard thousands of words about rumors
and the need to contain them.
What do you think would happen
if I didn't show up to this "Vanity Fair" Event?
I've already RSVP'd and given them a list
of phony dietary restrictions just to cause a scene.
I told them I was pesca-pescatarian.
Which is one who eats solely fish who eat other fish.
I think my absence would be noted.
Erlich brings up a good point.
It's true. Let us not forget Meinertzhagen's Havers--
Yes, yes, Meinertzhagen's Haversack.
We all remember his sack.
Okay, fine. Yeah.
Sure. You can come. I can't stop you.
I'll be taking the car and the hotel room
and you're going to have to drive yourself.
Consider it my farewell dinner.
See you at the event.
- Jared, are you okay? -It's just so many emotions.
The board seat. I feel regret and glee
that you would choose to honor me,
and terror at not living up to your expectations,
and compassion for Erlich's loss.
Oh, Donald, you've come undone.
You still want him on the board?
Hi, there. Checking in. Richard Hendricks.
Fuck me. Hey, Richie.
Oh, God. Hey, Russ.
What's up, boy genius? You here fucking?
No. No, no, no fucking.
Just, uh, here for the "Vanity Fair" Dinner.
Oh, yeah, I know that stupid dinner.
Bunch of VC douchebags jerking each other off.
Speaking of, I got this girl at the bar,
I'm trying to take her up to the presidential suite
before her fucking bridesmaids ruin the whole thing,
but they're telling me it's booked.
Who is it? Is it Gore? Fuck that guy.
- Oh, God. - I saw Pied Piper launched.
Haven't tried it, probably won't.
I don't even want to think about how fucked I got
missing out on Erlich's shares. Fuck.
Wait, he-- he tried to sell you his shares?
Well, half of them. He was pretty desperate to stay on the team.
Well, he didn't mention anything about this to me.
Of course not. Why would he?
It's fucking humiliating losing all your money.
You think when I dropped below a billion
I walked around telling everybody? Fuck no.
You guys were the only ones who knew,
and I actually thought about having you killed.
- I'm sorry, what? - So Erlich and I, like two weeks ago,
we had a contract ready:
five mil I was gonna pay him for half his shares.
It was a win-win. Then that robot, Laurie Bream,
sweeps in and cockblocks the whole thing.
She forces him to sell her all his shares.
You think she's gay?
Maybe. It hasn't come up. I, uh-- so wait, she outbid you?
Outbid me? No, she didn't have to.
You don't even know how your own fucking company works?
All right, Mr. Hendricks, we have you staying one night
in a deluxe double.
Okay, do you have a tub in that room?
Does he have a tub in that room?
I don't know. There's no way of telling.
You know what? Fuck it.
I'm gonna take her to the "W."
She's so drunk she won't know the difference.
See you around, Richie.
Hey, it's CJ. Listen, I'm hearing a rumor
about some serious ugliness going on at Pied Piper.
I've heard it from three different people now.
You need to call me.
Fuck.
What in God's name is the reason to get a higher education?
You can just buy a megafreeze for 35 cents.
Laurie, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, uh, Richard Hendricks,
- do you know Mark Pincus? - Hello.
- Big fan. - Oh, okay. Yes.
- Sorry, just one second. - Yes. Oh, all right.
I'm sorry to cut away like this.
We can continue discussing this.
Okay, uh, look,
I know Erlich sold you all of his shares.
I'm just, uh, wondering exactly how that happened.
Ah, yes. It was one of my finer moments.
Erlich came to me with an outside offer
to sell half of his Pied Piper shares.
To Russ Hanneman for five million dollars. Yes, I know.
But somehow you ended up with all of his shares. How?
Oh, well, as you know, the same onerous terms you accepted
when you took Russ Hanneman's money,
they transferred to me when I bought him out.
These included the right to block any transfer of stocks
with a majority vote of the board. A board which I control.
- I don't understand. - Of course you do.
If I have approval of any buyer,
and I am the only buyer I approve,
then I can set my own price.
So I asked Mr. Bachman for a thorough accounting of his debts, uh,
which ran to approximately $713,000.
And how much did you give him?
Jesus. So, he walked away with nothing.
Uh, yes. And so as I said,
you're the one who accepted these terms,
so you're the one who enabled this action on my part.
All credit goes to you, Richard. Excuse me.
Dick. Dick Costolo. One moment.
I need to speak with you.
It's expensive to re-plant.
No. The vines are bad. The soil is bad.
Excuse me, what is that?
That's pesca-pescatarian.
- It's fish that-- - Actually, just bring me one of those.
- Me, too. - Yeah, waiter, I'll take on, too.
- I want one. - I want one of those also.
Wait, hey, hey, I'd like that also.
Excuse me, if he's having one, I want one.
- You're getting that, I want it, too. - Excuse me!
I thought you were at the dinner.
I left.
Erlich never showed. Is he here?
Yeah. He's hiding in the backyard.
- Why? - Have you not seen the article?
No.
"Is Erlich Bachman the Dumbest Man in Tech?"
What the hell is this? I never sent anything out.
- Who did they talk to? - Erlich.
This is CJ's blog.
He outed himself to protect Pied Piper.
This is way harsher than anything you ever wrote.
Plus, there's the visual component.
Speaking of... where's your jacket, Jared?
That's quite a piece.
Informative. Thorough.
You certainly know how to make an impact.
And I guess I don't have to worry about any rumors coming out.
Those are handled.
You know, Erlich, uh, Pied Piper still needs a head of PR.
You seem to be well-versed in media outreach.
And by your own admission in that article,
your head is-- what did you say?
--so far up your own ass you can see the future.
And that could be useful...
if we need a pre-cog...
in a way?
I don't know if you're available, so...
Are you offering me a job?
Well, we have a good option package.
it won't be quite what you had, but it's something.
That's very generous.
So things could go back to the way they were before.
Well, no. No. Not exactly the way they were.
No, no. Uh, well, this would be an actual job
and you would have responsibilities.
Would this job have a title?
Something, say, Chief Evangelism Officer?
So, CEO?
- Oh, my goodness! - What the fuck was that?
Richard.
The Pied Piper app just got accepted to the Hooli store.
What? Holy shit.
Gavin Belson just presented us
with his bare buttocks in submission.
We beat him. I don't-- I don't hug. No.
Um, okay, hey, look, uh,
time to issue your first press release, right?
It's very late, Richard, and I'm very high.
Erlich, I don't care.
You have to do it, okay? Now.
- It's your job. - Okay.
All right.
CJ Cantwell. Erlich Bachman.
The reason I'm calling has absolutely nothing to do
whatsoever with the fact that I own half of your blog
and everything to do with the fact
that I was just named Chief Evangelism Officer of Pied Piper.
Feel free to abbreviate that,
whatever acronym is most economical.
And I have a story.
Well, if it's anything like this last one, I am all for it.
I am getting so many paid views on your tell-all.
Everyone in the Valley is reading it.
Well, that's good... for you...
at my expense, I guess.
Anyway, I had no choice.
As you said, it was going to come out one way or another.
Why? No one knew about any of it until you told me.
What do you mean?
You said that you had heard from a bunch of people
that there are all these rumors about ugly shit
going down at Pied Piper.
That's literally the only reason that I told you any of this.
What? Oh, yeah, three different people told me
that Pied Piper had the ugliest jackets they'd ever seen.
Jackets?
I was going to do, like, a whole swag fail thing, you know.
That could have been cool, no?
Who the fuck cares about jackets?
Hey, come on, babe
Follow me I'm the Pied Piper
Follow me, I'm the Pied Piper
And I'll show you where it's at
Tables.
Tables are made so a person can sit down and do something.
Or nothing.
Any person can sit at a table,
and if the table is large enough, many people.
To make jokes, eat a meal, tell stories.
Tables are for people to be together and share.
And that is why tables are like Pied Piper.
Grapefruits, postcards, hugs.
These are things people share to connect, to come closer.
To open up about ideas and things that make us feel alive,
like air, ballet, amazing haircuts, weird countries,
three-alarm chili, mountains, continents, the Earth, life.
Life is beautiful and sad and hopeful and dangerous.
So maybe the reason we share so much
is because we understand that without sharing,
we can't survive.
And sharing is tables.
Pied Piper.
Yes. Tables. I see. It's a metaphor.
It's a wonderful ad spot. Yeah. We're all just tables.
I love what you've done with the place.
It's a really nicely done place.
Say, is that your dog?
It's a dog.
You and I have never really had much of a rapport, have we?
It's... wanting.
Oh, look.
Well, we're almost there. Prepare to gather, everyone.
No, I didn't say to gather. I simply said prepare to gather.
- Monica, hey. - Oh, hey. How's it going?
- You holding up okay? - Not really.
I know. Her parties are always deeply weird.
Hey, um, I guess this is as good a time as any to say it,
but, um, I'm really sorry for not getting Pied Piper.
And to be honest, it's really embarrassing to be so fucking wrong.
Well, here's the thing, you, uh, you might not be.
What? What are you talking about?
okay. So, well,
Pied Piper launches and everything's great,
and we spent a fucking bazillion dollars, on the Tables ad
and now we are almost at 500,000 installs, right?
- Yeah. What's the problem? - Well, as you know,
installs isn't really the metric that matters.
We need daily active users, people who come back to the platform.
Okay, so how many daily users do you actually have?
Okay, what would-- what would be a number
that would make you say, "Ugh, oh, that's bad."
I don't know, like, 100,000?
Are you less?
How much less?
19,000. - 19-- 19,000 less than a hu--
- 81,000? - No. No, just 19,000.
- That's the only number. - What?
- That's-- that's terrible. - Yeah. I'm aware.
Well, yeah, that's art, not a chair.
Richard! Oh, my-- well, you haven't told Laurie yet, have you?
- No. - Okay. Well, who else knows?
Dinesh and Gilfoyle? - No.
Erlich?
No.
Well, apparently Jared knows.
Yeah, Pied Piper's sort of what I'm known for,
but I'm into a lot of cool stuff.
Like, a lot.
You seem surprised.
I'll give you an example. A few months ago,
I'm at my computer, freestyling,
just kind of jammin' out, you know,
before I knew it I had thrown together
the greatest video-chat app the world has ever seen.
So you invented Skype a few months ago?
Great ideas just sort of flow through me.
The platform, you know, it's sort of a group project,
but, uh, the video-chat app, that's my solo album.
Oh, Robert. - I'm Dinesh.
What the fuck is going on with you?
Hmm? Could you be more specific?
You're hiding something.
What? No, I'm not.
Everything's fine. You know, everything's fine.
That's a lie.
I can tell because you subscribe
to traditional Judeo-Christian mores of right and wrong.
You're made uncomfortable by untruth.
My commitment to LaVeyan Satanism grants me certain freedoms.
There is no good and evil, there's only self.
- Would you like a beverage? - Yes, I would.
Lie. You just want me to go to the bar and leave you alone.
Gil... you crack me up.
Lie.
I terrify you, as I should.
Get out of here.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, so, I just spoke with my friend
who runs a market research firm,
she's gonna set up a focus group for the platform,
put it in the hands of some real users,
and hopefully it'll be super obvious what's going wrong.
- Okay, great. - Clink, clink, clink. Gather.
Faster, please. Gather faster. We're close.
We need to see the numbers change.
It's going great. Uh, they've been engaging
with the platform for about an hour now.
- They're just starting the Q and A. - Uh, great.
Thank you, everyone, for sharing your feelings
on the revolutionary new Pied Piper platform.
Now, Bernice, you say here that you were...
totally freaked out by the platform.
What specifically totally freaked you out?
Everything. Just every single thing about it.
Just, like, how it worked.
Now, who else found themselves
totally freaked out by this platform?
Barry, Warren, Natalie, Martina,
Gwen, Amy, Walker, and Clay.
You were all totally freaked out.
Was anyone not totally freaked out?
Clark? Good. What was your reaction?
It just made me feel stupid.
This file sync thing is confusing.
When I put videos into my main folder, it says it uploaded them,
but then I didn't see where they went.
It said stuff was on my phone and my iPad,
but when I looked at the memory, it said, zero K used,
so stuff wasn't on there.
That's the platform. He's describing the platform
and what's great about it. Well, clearly he doesn't get it.
clearly none of these people get it. Maybe this is a bad group.
This is the fifth one today
and it's the least hostile reaction we've seen.
Okay, well, everyone that I showed the beta to loved it. Loved.
- Oh, shit. - What?
Who did you give the beta to?
- Your friends. Engineers. - Well, yeah, Monica.
I wanted to give it to people who would understand
what I'm trying to do, so I could get useful feedback.
And with all due respect, I gave it to you,
the one person without a computing background,
and you said it felt engineered.
- Oh, shit. - Yeah.
You're trying to sell the platform to regular people,
but you never actually put it in the hands of regular people.
Like them.
Shouldn't there be a download button?
Did they honestly forget to add a download button?
You know what, Richard, why don't we just go...
I mean, who designed this thing?
I did. I designed it.
Excuse me? Who are you?
Uh, my name is Richard Hendricks, I'm the CEO of Pied Piper.
Oh, my God.
Oh, you're the one who forgot the download button.
Yes.
But no. No, actually,
there is no download button because, um, well,
you don't need a download button. We're past that.
I mean, that's the old thing. This guy, actually,
he should have told you that.
I'm a moderator, not an advocate.
Okay, well, with Pied Piper,
you don't need to download anything or send anything at all, anywhere,
because the second you take a photo or a video
or compose a text message,
it's on all of your devices instantly.
- So it's all on my phone? - Yes.
Wrong! It says zero K used, so it's not on there.
Yes, well, that's the best part about the platform right there.
Yes, uh, because you're right, it's not actually on the phone.
But you don't need it to be on the phone
if you can see it on the phone,
even though there's nothing there at all.
But... where the hell is it?
Everywhere.
And nowhere, sort of.
Let me, uh, let me just take a step back here
and explain it in a simpler way.
- Um, sorry, what was your name? - Bernice.
Bernice. What did you have for breakfast today?
- Scrambled eggs. - Scrambled eggs.
And what's in the eggs?
Electrons. Right?
And we all know how electrons exist in orbitals.
Multivalent states? No?
No one knows this? Okay.
Okay, that's fine. Bad example. That's on me.
I'll... I'm going to use the whiteboard here.
You're gonna... you're gonna love this. Okay.
Then, once we hit a critical mass of users,
the volume of data moving through the system
will enable the neural net to start optimizing the platform.
It will actually get smarter and faster all on its own.
Is that like when I'm texting
and my phone starts guessing what I'm going to say?
This goes way beyond autocomplete.
Actually, all of your devices will begin helping each other
in ways that we can't even design or predict.
Okay, but see, the problem is... Terminator.
What? No. No, no. No, no, no. No.
I can assure there is no Skynet type of situation here.
No. Pied Piper will in no way
become sentient and try to take over the world.
He just told us he couldn't predict it.
I'm just saying... everybody died.
- Mm-hm, yeah. - You're right.
In those movies, there were a lot of casualties.
Quite scary to think. It's food for thought.
Speaking of...
Can we order some pizzas in here?
So, when we put our files into a Pied Piper folder,
they get split up into tiny bits
and spread across a network of other users' devices?
Yes, that's, uh, peer-to-peer distribution. Continue.
But they can't look at any of our files
because they only have tiny, scrambled pieces of them?
- Encrypted sharding. - Clark with the assist. Great.
- Uh, go on. - But we can look at any of our files anytime,
anywhere even though they're not actually on any of our devices.
Yes. Yes, Bernice, that's it.
That's Pied Piper. That's everything.
So it's all on our phones even though it sort of isn't.
Oh, my God. That's awesome.
Isn't it? Yeah.
So, uh, what do you think? Will you use Pied Piper now?
- Well, yeah, I think I will. - Me, too,
- now that you've explained how it works. - There you go.
That's what we've been aiming for.
They get it!
What's he smiling at?
This data was corrupted the second he walked in that room.
So we're tanking, and it's because we're too good.
That's one way of looking at it. Uh, yes.
Yes, we have created a product so far ahead of its time,
people are having difficulty wrapping their heads around it.
Well, then we just need to change the platform, right?
- We simplify it. - Well, we can't.
It's not as if I don't want to,
it's just that we literally can't do it.
Um, if you build an airplane
and people are afraid of anything that flies,
you can't just take the wings off of it,
because, at that point, all you're left with is a really slow,
super expensive shitty bus.
No, uh, we built an airplane, we got to fly it.
What's the point of flying if it's fucking empty?
I think people will want to fly
once they realize how cool the platform is.
Guys, I know we're in a tough spot right now,
and I know we needed a quarter million DAU's
in order to get our next round of funding, but this is it.
I think we can do this. All we got to do
is just take every last dollar that we have,
which is, uh... Sorry, uh, Jared, what?
Well, after the Table ads,
the salaries, recruiter fees...
You know what? I haven't run the numbers.
It would be irresponsible to estimate.
Okay, uh, is it less than a million dollars?
- Oh, God, yeah. - Okay.
- It's higher than 500,000, right? - Yeah.
I guess it's about $697,240.
But don't quote me on that.
Okay, we use that money to do outreach, tutorials,
user meetups, uh, create a guerrilla marketing campaign
that explains how cool the platform is.
I know it's not ideal, but,
um, I really think we can pull this off.
Yeah, that seems doable.
Lie.
Or here's another idea: We could put the platform on hold,
take the money we have left and pivot to something
that doesn't require hours of explanation.
You know, I've been showing people the video-chat app
- that I hacked together and... - Shut up, Dinesh!
You ungrateful pricks, all of you.
Your tepid response to our intrepid boss
makes me ill.
His plan, will it work?
Almost certainly not.
All of you will likely look back at this time in your lives
and realize you wasted a whole year with nothing to show for it.
But if this company is a plane,
then this is Richard's goddamn plane,
and if he wants to fly it in the side of a fucking mountain,
that is his prerogative and it is our duty to climb on,
strap in and have a fiery death right behind him.
I don't-- I don't know about that, but--
Richard, the floor.
Crashing aside, I think this is the plan and, uh,
really, what other option do we have?
Well, I know what option I have.
I can quit. So I quit.
Okay. Any... anybody else?
Guys, no.
Look, Douglas,
customer support is going to be a big part of this.
We need you guys if we're going to get 250,000 users.
I barely have any customers to support, Richard.
And the only way you're going to get that many users
is if you go to one of those click farms in Bangladesh
and pay for them.
Good fuckin' luck, man. I'm out.
Guys, wait.
Jared, let them go.
I have to do their exit interviews.
I guess I can do them on their walk to their cars.
Richard, we're better off without them.
Lie.
This is intolerable. A man can only take so much.
Banished from my own company? No.
I'm just going to give them what they want. I'm going to resign.
We can go to Haiti, build orphanages.
Haiti?
Is it not said that one should think globally and act locally?
I'm not acting at all.
Lao Tzu teaches the best fighter is never angry.
More important than the blow is knowing when to strike.
Like, perhaps, after we experience
the executive white water rafting trip in Coeur D'Alene?
Gavin, do you have a moment?
Yes.
Alone?
Of course. Denpok?
What?
Give us a moment, please?
Gavin, I'm really not supposed to be talking to you,
but there's something I think you should know about.
I'm listening.
A customer service rep that just left Pied Piper
is on campus right now interviewing for a job.
Why would anyone leave Pied Piper now?
I thought maybe you'd want to ask him yourself.
Well done. Well done.
Okay. Thank you for coming in, Douglas.
Yeah. Right this way. Okay.
Douglas.
Consider the possum. Nature's...
Gavin, if you're bringing another animal into this board room,
this meeting is over.
Of course not. Don't insult me.
Gentlemen and lady of the Hooli board,
I am the possum to which I refer.
Playing dead to outwit those who wish me harm.
But it's time to end the charade.
I'm sorry, Gavin. What charade?
For months, I've led the world to believe
that my Endframe division was pursuing
a broad-based compression platform
in direct competition with Pied Piper.
But secretly, I knew that any such platform was destined to fail.
But Pied Piper is not failing.
It's the most popular app in the Hooli store.
One of the most installed, yes.
But I happen to know, because I make it my business to know,
that their daily active user numbers are abysmal.
So, you were never developing a platform.
Why didn't you tell us this?
Says the chairperson of the board
that recently asked for my resignation.
Trust cuts both ways.
I thought it best to leave you out of it.
I'm sorry, Gavin.
I'm just finding all of this impossible to believe.
If you were never building a platform,
what did we just spend three-quarters of a billion dollars on?
I'm not going to tell you.
Instead, I'm going to let the new head of product
for Hooli/Endframe tell you.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Jack Barker,
and I'm very excited to introduce
Hooli/Endframe's newest product...
We call it The Box.
Pied Piper's loss is Hooli's gain.
May the best product win.
Can I get you a shirt, sir? There you go.
Actually, let me ask you a question, uh, Emily.
What did you have for breakfast today?
- Um, yogurt. - Okay.
And, uh, we all know what's in yogurt, right?
Electrons. Multivalent states.
Welcome to the Pied Piper Informational Seminar.
Now, what is Pied Piper? Excellent question.
Here it is.
One of your Hooli/Endframe boxes
would go right here in this rack.
Okay, let me show you the next location
in which we would install one of your boxes.
- Congratulations, Jack. - And congratulations to you, Gavin.
- Hey, John? - John?
John?
A lot of people have raised their hands, uh,
throughout this seminar saying,
hey, is thing like the Terminator?
Uh, no. Not at all.
Hi, how big are your files?
Dodge Challenger? Hoodie?
John?
- John? - John!
- John? - John!
This is Pied Piper, guys. Okay?
If I could just explain it one more time.
Guys? Please don't leave. I beg you.
Hi, Bernice. Yeah.
We kind of thought we nailed it with Tables,
but you say you want something light, fun, inviting.
But most of all, you want something that delivers
a step-by-step guide to all of the nuances of your platform.
- Yeah. - All of this with the caveat
that you don't have enough money for even a minuscule ad buy.
Um, yes, that's right.
That's a pretty small target to hit.
Anyway, here's what we came up with.
Oh, hello, welcome to Pied Piper.
How can I help you?
What in the name of fuck is that?
Well, his name is Pipey,
the Pied Piper Piper.
He's fun. And, uh, you know, the demo's interactive.
Looks like you want to compress a movie file!
Can I help? You know, with Pied Piper's revolutionary
neural network, optimized, sharded data distribution system,
it's just six clicks away!
Follow me!
I like it.
- That's a fuckin' lie. - Yeah.
So, Richard, you want us to take the most sophisticated
and technically complex compression based platform
- ever created and add that? - Still here!
Well, after the booths at CES and South by Southwest,
all of our outreach, the Dodge Challenger...
Still here!
Plus, all the cost of working up, you know, this,
- we are pretty much all out of money. - Follow me!
Okay.
Somebody seems confused!
Let me walk you through Pied Piper's proprietary
peer-to-peer content distribution system, consisting of...
Richard? Are you indisposed?
Richard, can I come in?
Richard, I'm-- I'm sorry the guys didn't like Pipey.
It's over, Jared.
Well, you know, a lot of animated characters have rough starts.
Early Bugs Bunny cartoons were just garish displays
of anti-Japanese hysteria,
and now he's the face of Warner Bros.
I'm not talking about Pipey, Jared. I'm talking about Pied Piper.
We're dead. We fought Gavin Belson, Russ, Hooli,
the lawsuit, that fucking box,
all so we could build our platform the way we wanted to.
And we did, but I guess you just can't fight public opinion,
except for one woman named Bernice.
Face it, Jared, being too early is the same as being wrong.
- We'll figure it out. - I don't know if we will.
Besides, I think I'm getting tired of being kicked in the balls.
Come on, we have a few weeks of runway left.
I don't want to say exactly how much.
Again, I'm not comfortable estimating, but...
Take what's left of it and divide it up amongst the guys.
I mean, it won't be anywhere close to
what you're owed in back pay,
but at least it's something.
Don't give up. Richard, come on, not yet.
We've got to hang on, we've got to see what happens.
Something will turn around. I know it will.
- You really believe that? - Absolutely.
Gilfoyle's right, you're... you're a terrible liar.
Just, uh, set an all-hands for tomorrow at 9 A.M.
And I'll... I'll tell the gang.
It's over, Jared.
And lastly, our deal to furnish Endframe boxes
to Maleant Data System Solutions has officially closed,
putting us far ahead of even the most
optimistic profit targets issued by this very board.
Gavin, it appears we owe you an apology.
We'd like to restore your full status as CEO and chair
with a significantly revised bonus and stock options package.
Thank you.
Of course, apology accepted.
I would like nothing more than to move forward
in a harmonious and productive manner.
Actually, with that in mind,
there's something I'd like to show you.
It's outside. Is... is that all right?
A little field trip, if you will?
Just down here.
A little farther.
We're almost there.
Just out here, everyone. Almost there.
Consider the elephant.
Legend has it its memory is so robust
it never forgets.
And I assure you, gentlemen of the Hooli board,
and lady, neither do I.
Okay, guys, uh,
we need to have a serious discussion about
the future of the company.
What? Why is everyone smiling?
Richard, something happened last night.
The daily active users are up, way up.
- Look at it. Look. - Really?
Holy shit!
Did we just get 7,000 users in a day?
We sure did! We're back!
I don't know if it was the outreach or the tutorials,
but we seem to be getting traction.
Richard, you pulled us out of a nosedive.
Of course, inevitably, we will
run out of fuel and plummet towards the Earth,
leaving only a crater behind of torn flesh and excrement,
but in the meantime, we are flying high!
Yeah. I guess we are.
You know, it's crazy, just last night I was, uh,
telling Jared that I thought we should shut down the company.
Well, perfect timing then, huh?
Uh, excuse me. I should get this.
Hey, Jared.
- Are those numbers legit? - Of course.
- All right, then. - This is Jared.
So, are we happy?
Yeah. Worked out great.
So let's keep the 7,000 users that I bought
and add another thousand a day for the next week.
You got it, buddy.
How the fuck does something like this happen?
How does an elephant just die?
He was very old and depressed.
He'd recently been rescued from the circus,
but as it turns out, he actually really loved performing.
Who gives a fuck about the elephant?
What about me?
This does not look good.
I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how to remove him.
He weighs 9,000 pounds.
Cut it up.
Take it out in pieces.
I-- I don't mean to interrupt,
but-- but I could call in a personal favor
and get a helo crew out of Travis AFB
with a Sikorsky Skycrane to airlift it out
and drop it in the ocean right after dark.
No muss, no fuss.
There.
Was that so hard, Patrice?
Because Hoover sure didn't think so.
I mean, I just found my footing again,
and you put me in danger of losing it all
over some fucking elephant?
Gavin, you always said that
here at Hooli, "In order to achieve greatness,
we must first achieve goodness."
Right.
So?
So...
I was a bridesmaid at Sean Parker's wedding
when he handed out live bunnies as plush toys.
That wasn't goodness.
It was badness.
And so is this.
You're using endangered animals
just to make points at board meetings.
I'm drawing thoughtful, zoological comparisons.
But couldn't you just show them a picture of these animals?
A simple Hooli search would yield thousands of choices.
Patrice, I thank you for your honesty,
and I will repay you with my own.
I honestly never want to see you in my offices again.
You're fired.
Hoover?
- Scramble that Skycrane. - Yes, sir.
Please, uh, come in.
Come in. Have a seat.
I won't take a lot of your time.
I promise.
Okay.
Would you like some tea?
I can put a kettle on the hot plate.
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.
There's no trouble.
You know what? I have a box of--
of Russell Stover's if the spiders didn't get into 'em.
Jared, is this about the fake users?
You know?
Two days ago, I wanted to look at user behavior to figure out
what spurred the sudden uptick,
and, uh, well, I noticed something.
Almost all of our new users
were just uploading a single photo
into a shared folder, and then the next day,
they would take the photo out and then put it back in
the day after that and that's it.
You know, just enough to qualify as a daily active user.
Classic click-farm behavior.
And then I remembered our conversation in the bathtub,
and it just-- it had to be you.
Richard, I am so sorry.
It's okay.
- Would it make you feel better to-- to strike me? - No.
You-- you had good intentions, Jared.
Honestly, don't give it another thought.
Just, you know...
you and I right now are the only ones that know about it.
Okay?
And in a few weeks, when we run out of money,
this will all be over anyway.
- Richard? - Yes?
We have a secret.
Yeah.
I mean, I swear to God,
your dicks would have blown
out of the back of your assholes
if you had been there, hand to God.
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Richard, sit down. I did it.
I saved the company.
What do you-- What? How?
Jared, have you been crying?
Yes, but for ordinary reasons.
Please, go on.
Okay. I was at The Rosewood for lunch.
I mean, it was the lunch hour.
I was there, I wasn't eating, the usual.
So, I walk over to Andreessen and I say something funny,
but he stone-faces me.
What did you say?
It doesn't matter. The point is, it was hilarious,
but he gave me nothing and neither did his friends.
Then I realized why.
You're not funny?
No, Gilfoyle, but that is.
No, it's that everybody thinks
Pied Piper is in this death spiral,
so it would be inappropriate to laugh at my hysterical joke.
And it hits me.
I know something that they don't.
I know about the uptick.
The uptick?
Yes, the uptick!
The recent sudden surge in users.
Yeah. That.
Yes, that. So, while our fortune is rising,
everybody else thinks that it's plummeting,
and I can use these opposing forces
to a multiplying effect like a slingshot,
and then I make a decision.
I'm gonna make a move.
So, I say something cryptic about the uptick,
and I walk away.
- What did you say? - I don't know. I can't remember.
But I walk over and I see McNamee's having the short rib,
which I hear is delicious but not too heavy,
and then I say to him,
"You're gonna have to tuck in your tie-dye
if you want to eat here."
- How's that relevant? - It's not.
But the people that I just walked away from don't know that.
All they know is that I'm over there
exchanging witty banter with McNamee,
and about what, they don't know.
It's all that they do want to know.
And then, it settles in.
F.O.M.O.
The fear of missing out.
Suddenly, it feels like time is slowing down.
I could see every move I was going to make 12 steps ahead.
It was like I was Bobby Fischer if he could really fuck.
I go outside, I walk across the street to Graylock,
I check in on Instagram,
Vinod Khosla calls me, asks me what I doing there.
I say, "I can't talk right now. Call me at Wood Opal."
Well, he does, and then suddenly Wood Opal is going,
"What's Khosla got going on with Bachman?"
Meanwhile, I'm taking a leak at a Restoration Hardware.
I jack off a little bit. I don't cum.
And then it snowballs.
I deftly played Ross Loma against Index Ventures.
And because of that, the big kahuna bites.
Sequoia.
I spend the next 20 minutes denying calls from Jim Goetz,
over and over.
And yes, I'm jacking off, but I don't need to ejaculate
because by the time I listen to the messages,
I've got offers, I've got counters,
I've got counter-counters.
I cum.
When the dust settled...
and the losers went home, all that was left was this.
"Hello, Mr. Bachman.
"Coleman Blair Partners would like to offer Pied Piper
"a Series B round of $6 million
on a $60 million valuation."
Yeah!
Holy shit.
And this asshole wanted to pivot to video chat.
Still valid.
Although less sexy now. I'll concede that.
It's my Mona Lisa.
And the entire cornerstone
upon which I built this motherfucking cathedral
that I will forever be remembered for,
was this beautiful little uptick.
I think I have a bottle of Cold Duck in the crisper.
Who's drinking? Come on!
I got a bottle of Martinelli's for you, Jared.
This is a big day!
We did it! Yes!
I'll talk to him.
I-- I'll talk to him.
Here's my Hooli badge.
And I have a hanging tag
on my rear-view mirror for the parking structure.
Can I just mail that in?
No, you need to go get that now.
Okay.
Hey, Dinesh.
I'm just, um, looking for Erlich. Have you seen him?
Oh, he went to the liquor store.
Gotta keep the party going, you know?
Oh yeah. Yeah, Series B. Crazy, right?
Oh, it's unreal. Yeah.
Almost like some of our users.
What?
What-- what does that mean?
Oh, "Unreal" has so many meanings.
"Fake," "Paid for,"
"One person in Bangladesh pretending to be 6,000."
Okay.
All right, Dinesh, um--
Oh, no.
I don't want to know a fucking thing.
Okay then. Great.
I won't tell you anything because nothing happened.
Great.
Okay.
But if something did happen,
and we're not saying it did,
the fact remains
that leaves us in a very advantageous position.
There's a lot of money on the table.
And it would be a shame if that went away.
You know what else would be a shame...
is if I couldn't find my flash drive.
Gilfoyle, have you seen my flash drive?
Right, the one with the zombie script on it?
Why yes, the zombie script that randomizes user action
in platforms such as Pied Piper.
You mean so that
fake users and click farms would be
absolutely indistinguishable from real users?
Oh, I suppose.
I mean, especially during due diligence,
like the kind done by VCs or possible future reviews
done by certain regulatory bodies.
It also had photos of my auntie.
Anyway, Gilfoyle, have you seen it?
I have not.
Mm, well, Richard, keep an eye out for it, will ya?
Hey, Gilfoyle, you wanna come inside and help me
get a new flash drive on www.staples.com?
Yeah, I think we're sort of done with the ruse.
Okay. Okay, fine. Well, whatever you did
or didn't do, that was serial-killer-level shit.
Agreed.
I think I finally respect you as a CEO.
Fuck.
This is fraud.
Is it?
I mean, our-- our platform does exactly what we say it does.
Okay? It's not like we're lying about it
like fucking Theranos.
And if our platform works, which we know it will,
we will make them billions of dollars.
Everybody wins, Jared.
You still believe that, right?
That, if given enough time, the platform will catch on?
Richard, don't weaponize my faith in you against me.
Your faith made all this possible.
It's wrong.
Well, every time I try to do the right thing, I get fucked.
And if I do the right thing here,
we're done. That's it.
Doesn't seem like much of an option, does it?
Dang, they're all just so good.
Gavin, CJ Cantwell, line one.
Dang, let's pick this up tomorrow.
CJ
CJ.
I'm finishing a story I'd love a comment on.
It's about the death of an unpermitted Indian elephant
named Maurice in your sculpture garden and its subsequent
illegal dumping in the San Francisco Bay.
That's preposterous.
Mm, I have a very good source.
What do you propose we do here?
Well, I have one idea.
And what, pray tell, might that be?
CJ sold the blog for $2 million.
No shit.
Bachmanity rides again.
Well, not exactly. Uh, I called Big Head
to tell him that our share was worth half a mil each,
and, uh, not five minutes later,
his father, one Nelson Bighetti, Sr.,
called me and explained that I was never to
have any financial dealings with his son
in perpetuity, uh, ever
or he would get very Italian on me.
And I'm not interested to find out what that means.
Okay. Shall we?
To Coleman Blair! Let's close this fucker.
Good luck, fellas.
Remember, you just sit there and look pretty.
Leave all the talking to me.
And if you mention my Mont Blanc,
then, uh, don't make it overt, like I told you to.
But do.
Hey, what's up?
Are you guys out raising money from someone else?
Uh, Monica, it's, uh-- it's kind of a long story.
Why are you whispering?
Oh, my god, you're there right now, aren't you?
Jesus! Do you have any idea
how big of an asshole you're making me look here?
Laurie just lost her shit at me, okay?
So, you need to turn around and walk the hell out of there.
Erlich put all this together. I really had nothing to do with it.
You have everything to do with it.
You're the fucking CEO, Richard!
Whatever your company does is 100% on you!
Gentlemen.
They're ready for you.
Yes. I-- I gotta go.
Do not hang up on me.
Richard, do not--
So listen, we're pumped, guys.
We're thrilled to be getting into Pied Piper
right at this inflection point.
It's very exciting.
We are pumped as well. Aren't we, Richard?
- Richard. Pumped. - Pumped!
- We are pumped up. - Pumped up.
So we'll just need your John Hancock right here.
Oh, sure, Richard.
Uh, you can use my Montblanc.
This is an actual term sheet.
And once I sign this-- this, that's it, right?
Yup. No turning back.
You can have your lawyers vet
the actual stock purchase agreement
once we close here just to make sure
no one is pulling any funny business.
No, no. No, my lawyer is in jail, so.
So.
Oh, my god. I, uh...
Wow, I can't believe I didn't think of this
before, um, because,
well, let me put it to you this way.
What would you say if I told you that
the same compression that you know and love
is being used in a world-beating,
game-changing-- wait for it--
video conferencing application?
Wouldn't that be interesting?
What? You mean like Hooli-Chat?
This will be far superior to Hooli-Chat.
You may want to fund that instead.
In fact, why don't I, um--
why don't I just go home, I'll grab my laptop,
I'll come back here, I'll show it to you guys.
- It's not that far. I don't mind. -Richard, what--
I'll tell you what, I'll grab an Uber.
No, no, no, no. It's no problem.
- Richard, what the fuck are you doing? There. - I've ordered it.
Neal is in a blue Kia Sportage and he's right around the corner.
All right, all right. Look, look, look.
I don't know who else you're talking to about the platform,
but I'm willing to go up to seven million on 70.
Okay? But that's it.
You sign this thing right here and right now.
Bravo, Richard. Nice neg.
Now sign it.
Thank you. Very generous of you.
I just-- I just want to make sure
that you're aware of all the feedback
'cause we had some focus groups and there were some issues.
Just so you're clear,
people have been wondering, "Eh! Where are my files?
- "Zero K used? Where's the download button?" - Richard, Richard--
- The terminator--" - All right, all right, you know what?
- 'Cause it-- - I'm gonna sign it. Can I sign it? I'll sign it.
You can if you want, but we still need his signature.
Richard, sign it.
That's two years of runway.
- Sign it now! - I can't.
Why the fuck not?
Because the numbers are fake.
What?
What? What do you mean?
- What do you-- - We bought...
fake users from a Bangladeshi click farm.
The uptick was fake.
But the-- the vid chat...
is real.
Erlich, the fake users were just meant to cheer the guys up.
I had no idea you were gonna take those numbers--
And what, and go do my fucking job?
Pour everything I had into getting the best possible deal
for Pied Piper because I believe in them?
Well, that's all over now.
Richard, we are fucked!
In the amount of time that it took for us to get
from that office to right here,
every VC in the Valley knows about this.
If I signed those term sheets, I would be committing fraud.
That's a fucking crime!
You're saying you wanted me to--
No, I wanted you to fucking think about that
before you paraded me around the whole fucking valley
to sell your lie!
And then suddenly grew a thick, girthy conscience
and fucked me with it.
Are you Richard?
- Did you order an Uber? - Oh. No.
All you had to do was keep your fucking mouth shut
and sign that piece of paper.
We would have fixed it afterwards.
But you didn't. You caked your pants.
No, better yet, you caked my pants.
Fuck you, Richard Hendricks.
Fuck you.
Richard Hendricks, huh?
Prick.
Oh, hey, Monica.
Is Richard here? I heard what happened,
but he's not answering any of my calls.
We just wanted you to know for the record
that we had no idea any of that stuff was going on.
Still trying to wrap our heads around it.
Point is, don't beat yourself up about not seeing it.
I'm not beating myself up--
I hope you don't think we're guilty by association,
because then we would have to
think you're guilty by association, which we don't.
Just want to let you know that we would definitely work
with you again in the future.
It's good to know. Guys, thanks.
Um... is he in his room?
I mean, he said he was.
But...
I'm gonna go to his room.
Uh, what's up, Gleb?
I hear, uh, Richard shit bed, huh?
So, the platform is no goo-oo-oo-oo...
Fuck, now the vid chat's fucking up.
Odd, considering who wrote the code for it.
Not the code. The server is overloaded.
How is that possible? We only gave it to like 12 people.
Well, there's a few more than that using it now.
Holy shit.
For what it's worth, Richard,
I think you did the right thing.
And I can see now why you didn't want to come to us for funding.
You were trying to protect us.
Yeah.
Well, I really appreciate it.
Uh, Laurie wants out.
Even a whiff of fraud is a mortal sin for VCs.
She needs to wash her hands of any Pied Piper business.
She's forcing a sale.
Fuck.
Yeah, frick.
Yeah.
But it is an open auction,
and, you know, between the fraudulent numbers
and the real numbers,
you guys aren't exactly killing it out there.
So, there is a chance that no one will bid
and you might be able to buy back your own company
for next to nothing.
That will have to be for literally nothing
because we're out of money.
Jesus! Are you okay?
Yeah, we're fine.
All right, I spun together a few more servers.
That should handle the traffic.
Look at this. There are 157 people
using it near Gleb.
And 400 people using it near Tara in Boston.
Yeah, I told her to give it to her Satanist friends out there.
Looks like she did.
She knows 400 Satanists in Boston?
The Catholic church really did a number on that town.
Hey, Erlich, remember when Gilfoyle said that
my video chat app was a piece of shit
and that nobody would ever use it?
Well, he was wrong. Over 4,000 times.
Wow, and you developed that with the Pied Piper IP, right?
Well, then you can kiss that goodbye.
Oh, fuck.
Speaking of, I'm actually using
the first dollars of my blog windfall
on a trip to Kainchi Dham Ashram
in Nainital, India,
where Steve Jobs famously sought peace
and came up with the idea for a little product called the Lisa.
Good luck.
Richard, I'll expect you off the premises
by end of day.
Monica.
- I'll see you later. - Okay.
You know, you can stay here for one year. Free rent.
Jian-Yang!
Laurie!
Gavin.
You know Jack, of course.
That is correct.
Um, Gavin, can we address the elephant in the room?
- Sorry? - Pied Piper.
Right. Yes, of course.
I am forcing a sale.
Your Maleant dealings demonstrate
that you're still pursuing a middle-out.
Might you be interested in placing a bid?
Why would he want to bail out Raviga?
You said it yourself,
our compression play is thriving.
Fair enough.
You know what? I'm a completionist.
Even if I buy it just to throw it in the garbage,
I'd like to be the one to drive the final nail
in the Hendricks coffin.
I'll give you...
$900 for it?
I believe that is a joke.
You know what? I like nice, round numbers.
Make it...
a million?
A million dollars?
Gavin Belson gets to buy Pied Piper for $1 million
and Raviga gets all of it because of their liquidation preference
and I get jack shit?
Is that what you're telling me? Goddamn it.
I know this is the last way that you wanted it to end.
I'm really sorry.
Yeah, well, I-- I'll see you at the meeting.
Is that Hooli-Chat?
They fix it or something?
That didn't look shitty at all.
Actually, it's-- it's ours.
Um, the guys hacked it together.
I can send you an invite if you want.
Yeah. Cool. Thanks.
We got up to 4K users totally organically.
Oh, shit! 7K now.
Wow, we should have been focusing on this instead.
Not that it matters.
I mean, it's all gonna be property of Gavin Belson
in an hour, so.
That's ironic, huh?
N-- no, for real, I'm asking. Is it?
I don't know. I was just smiling.
Feels ironic.
Hey, uh, so thank you for, uh...
- letting me stay here. - No worries.
Steve says you're welcome to take my spot on the couch
until you can find a job and get your own place.
Thanks.
So, uh, when's your dad coming to pick you up?
Uh, a couple of hours I guess.
Then we're turning right around and going back to Phoenix.
You know, he said he wants to be able to
keep an eye on me and my money
and that I need to get a real job
to learn the value of a-- of a hard day's night
or something like that.
Well, um, I should probably get going to this board meeting.
Um, and you're probably gonna be gone when I'm back, so...
- guess this is it. - Yeah, I guess so.
See ya.
- Okay. - Okay.
- All right. Cool, man. - There we go.
Richard, e-- even though it's the last board meeting
and-- and essentially meaningless,
thank you for letting me be a part of it.
It's an honor.
Okay, you don't have to keep saying that.
Good day, all. This should be brief.
The only item on the agenda is,
of course, the authorization
of the sale of Pied Piper to the current high bidder.
Three "Yes" votes will approve the sale.
And as Raviga controls three of the board seats,
- it seems-- - I'm sorry. I--
I'm not doing it.
Oh, Monica, not again.
I'm sorry, but look, Richard has worked too hard
and I know that I can't stop it, but I'm not gonna vote
to let Pied Piper become the property of that asshole.
Monica, I also happen to find him contemptible.
But Pied Piper will be sold to the high bidder, period.
You know what? I don't care.
You want to fire me, fire me.
If we're not gonna adhere to the values
that Peter Gregory instilled, then I don't think I belong here.
Monica, you don't have to do this.
- I'm not voting yes. - Very well. You're off the board.
Excuse me! Man!
Do you work here?
Well, it was my first day actually.
- Everybody's been super ni-- - Sit.
You are now officially on the board of directors of Pied Piper.
Oh, okay. That's fine I guess.
When I point to you, you will vote yes.
Now, I move to vote on the sale of Pied Piper.
I vote yes.
I vote yes.
And Evan.
Evan?
I can't do it.
What? Why?
Because...
Monica?
I love you.
There. I said it.
And I could never do anything to make you sad.
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Do I have to pull the receptionist in here?
How does this compare with a typical board meeting?
All right, stop. Everybody, just stop.
We all know how this is gonna go,
so let's just get it over with. All right?
Um, I vote yes. There.
Okay? I approve the sale.
Three "Yes" Votes. Can this please just be done?
Very well.
- I vote yes also. - Irrelevant.
But thank you.
The sale is approved.
Pied Piper, its IP, and all of its assets
are now officially the property of Bachmanity, LLC.
Wait, sorry, did--
did you just say "Bachmanity"?
As in Erlich Bachman and Nelson Bighetti?
Yes, you know them.
They-- wait, they-- they had the highest bid?
I received a telephone call approximately 30 minutes ago
entering a bid of one million and one dollars
with a firm no-shop clause.
So when you were referring to the person who bought Pied Piper
as a contemptible asshole, you were talking about Erlich?
To which contemptible asshole did you think I was referring?
Gavin Belson.
I see. No.
This meeting is adjourned.
I thank you all for your time.
So... Bachmanity it is.
That's good.
So... should we give this thing a shot?
You and Big Head, huh?
sorry you had to cancel your trip.
And look, I-- I really appreciate all this.
I really think this video chat thing is gonna
be something, you know?
- I don't know if you've seen the numbers. - You want a number?
The percentage I give a fuck about you, zero.
It's trending steady.
And of course I've seen the numbers.
This is a business opportunity.
Nothing more. Big Head was your friend.
He was the one that, uh, talked me into it.
I don't trust you, Richard Hendricks.
And it's gonna take a long, long, long time
to regain my trust.
Are we clear?
Are we absolutely clear?
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Alway-- Aah!
You suck.
Oh, fuck, it's my dad again.
He's gotta be so pissed.
I can't believe this is happening, you guys.
I mean, I guess now we're a video chat company,
but the best part of it is it's us, you know?
Just us controlling our own destiny.
No, the best part of it is I own 50%.
Well, yes,
um, you and Big Head do own the entire company,
but I am the founder, it's my algorithm,
so I'm assuming I'm getting my original shares back, right?
Why would you assume that?
Well, when a tech company reboots,
it's normal to have a-- a conversation
about restructuring the cap table.
Good, 'cause I'm the guy that hacked together the video chat app
to see if that woman was hot, so...
Yeah, but it's not gonna scale
until I get in there and scrape all the Dinesh off.
Well, Laurie still hasn't called me back,
so I may need a new job.
And I'm assuming Pied Piper can't afford my salary,
so I'll need stock.
Do we really want it to be called Pied Piper anymore?
No, yes. Of cour-- of-- of course we want--
Why do we want to change the name? It's great.
Yeah, and we do already have the jackets.
Big. Head.
Big Head.
Go for Erlich.
Erlich Bachman, this is you as an old man.
I'm ugly and I'm dead. Alone.
I'm gonna let him have this one.
All right, uh...
well, I'm sorry to hear that, Future Me.
What a terrible thing.
I'll talk to you in several years.
You're up.
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue!
