Is that our P2P protocol?
- Yeah, I'm just hacking for fun. - Videochat?
Yes! I can... see you now.
It's me. Pakistani Denzel.
From the ashes will rise the phoenix
that shall be known as "Bachmanity."
That's what you're gonna call your company?
Coleman Blair partners would like to offer Pied Piper
six million dollars.
We'll just need your John Hancock.
- I can't. - Why the fuck not?!
Because the numbers are fake!
We bought fake users from a Bangladeshi click farm.
Laurie wants out.
Even a whiff of fraud is a mortal sin for VCs.
Pied Piper and all of its assets are now officially
the property of Bachmanity LLC.
- Did you just say "Bachmanity?" - They had the highest bid?
Bachmanity it is then.
Richard, you pulled us out of a nosedive.
Of course, inevitably we will plummet towards the earth,
but in the meantime we are flying high.
No, I'll get my car tomorrow. I had too many.
Got an Uber coming. Thank you.
That was fast.
Hello. For Jim?
Yep.
Oh, would you-- would you care for a water?
Why are your fingers orange?
It's-- It's iodine.
I've been... biting my nails,
so I put this on there to stop me from doing it.
Looks like Cheetos, tastes like asshole.
So, what do you do?
Venture capital over at Wood Opal.
Good.
Uh, can I take this?
- Sure. - All right.
My goodness, this video chat app
is light-years ahead of anything else out there on the market.
I agree.
Yes, and you can add multiple concurrent users
with no loss in picture quality, even on conventional 3G.
Let's see what happens when we add more friends.
Hi, friend. What's up?
Hello, friend.
Hey, should we add another friend?
Yeah, we should.
How many friends can we conference at the same time?
Well, thanks to the amazing new TURN server,
as many as you like.
What if someone is in an area with poor cellular reception?
I doubt it would even work.
And if it did, the lag, the video quality...
...that would be horrible.
Well, let's find out.
Could you keep your eyes on the road, please?
Yeah, got it. I'm on it.
Hey, friends.
Look at that. The image is so clear.
We all look amazing, don't we?
- Yeah, we really do. - Yes.
Is that really just on a cell signal?
Uh, yes. This is the amazing new company PiperChat.
Wait a minute.
I saw you at TechCrunch.
You're Richard Hendricks.
The very same. Yeah.
You're the fucking guy
that tried to walk into Coleman Blair with fraudulent numbers.
No!
- That was actually my fault. - Yes, but no.
I mean, that... that's the old thing.
This is the new thing,
and I can assure you, it's very, very real.
You're not even my driver.
This says Sandeep in an Escalade.
- Ah, shit. - Look, look.
No one will even talk to us, which is crazy.
We just surpassed 120,000 daily active users
and we're growing at a rate of 18 percent,
organically, week over week.
Richard, that's Facebook-level growth.
- Pull over now. - That is great!
Richard, Richard, do not pull over.
- You will never see him again if he gets out. - I am not involved!
Richard, can you hear me?
Okay, for real, Richard. You have to pull over.
Richard, do not... do not pull over.
- You'll never see him again. - Hey, are you on the shitter?
Pull the fuck over.
- Richard! - Okay.
What the fuck? Are you seriously trying to kidnap me right now?
No. It's the locks.
I don't know. It's not my car.
Child locks are on.
I was babysitting my friend Gloria's great-granddaughter.
It's on the left.
- Got it. Look, look, look. - God damn it!
Come on. Listen to me.
We are desperate. We need funding.
- You need funding? - Yes.
Hit a million daily active users
while sustaining the same kind of growth,
then everybody in town will be trying to kidnap you.
Problem solved.
Yeah, easy for you to say.
Can you imagine how much these servers are costing me
just to keep this ship afloat?
Right, and every new user increases our server cost.
Really? I'm sorry.
Is it hard to become a billionaire?
Welcome to the Valley, assholes.
- Fuck. - What a dick.
Well, assuming we don't get arrested,
looks like we have to work our asses off
to reduce our hosting bill.
If you actually get to a million users...
call me. My cell's on the back.
Oh, okay.
Did you finish?
Yeah, I just pushed my code.
Took me two fucking days,
but I broke up our entire code base into parallel services.
You know, this whole job would've been a lot easier
if you hadn't designed sloppy services in the first place.
Oh, silly me.
I guess when I hacked together
the video chat as an in-house tool,
I didn't foresee that hundreds of thousands of people
would shit themselves over how fucking awesome it was.
I'll never underestimate my talents again.
Don't worry. I'll continue to do it for you.
Less talk, more work, boys.
I'm not paying you to coffee klatsch
like a bunch of fucking yentas.
You're not paying us at all.
I'm not paying you because you're not the one
getting fucked face-first by your credit card company
because of massive AWS hosting fees.
Well, you should bear 100 percent of the company's cost,
seeing as you do own 100 percent of the company.
What's taking you so long to give us our fucking shares?
Recapping a company is complex.
But I assure you, Big Head and I are on the case.
You better be. We're not gonna work for free forever.
Hey, the Karachi Kid and I finished.
Did you push your code?
Actually, no.
Well, Your Highness, could you please push your code?
Well, I couldn't push that code,
because I didn't write that code.
What? We stayed up for two fucking days.
Why didn't you write your code?
Well, because I was working on something much better.
So, I started to optimize our code
to handle higher tr...
You're supposed to follow me.
I, uh, I started to optimize our code
to handle higher traffic.
Then it occurred to me,
why rewrite our old code
when I can build a new encoder
that doesn't strip away a ton of channels and metadata.
So, I extended my compression algorithm
to support-- get this-- 12-bit color.
Okay, so our users will be able to experience
a 10 percent increase in image quality
with absolutely no increase in server load whatsoever.
Just-Just-Just-- Just watch this.
Before.
After.
Before.
After.
Richard, I'm trying very hard
not to completely lose my shit right now.
I get it. I get it.
After every VC in town turned us down,
we decided that the best way to stay alive
until we got to a million users was to cut server usage.
Remember that?
The whole reason that Gilfoyle and I
stayed up for 48 fucking straight hours
was to decrease server load,
not keep it the same.
Technically, the reason why we stayed up for two days
was to maximize our ability to get a million users,
and I just did that.
Because who doesn't want 10 percent better image quality?
Who doesn't want it? Everyone.
Everyone doesn't want it!
We already have the best video chat.
People are using this on their cellphones.
They're not gonna be able to tell the fucking difference.
Guys, this is a better product,
and I'm the CEO,
and I'm gonna say this is where we go.
You fucking prick.
Guys... please be civil.
You hate the video chat.
I don't hate the video chat, Dinesh.
You've always hated the video chat,
because it's my thing,
and you wanna rewrite it to make it all about you.
You're fucking jealous.
Jealous? Jealous?
You built the video chat,
I'll give you that. Okay.
You did, but you did it using my algorithm.
Right, like when Picasso painted a masterpiece,
the guy who made the brushes and the paint
deserved all the credit, right?
So you're Picasso now?
I think I need to... leave,
but I love you guys.
Dinesh, I'm sorry,
but I think we should be doing a little bit more
with this revolutionary compression algorithm
than passable video chat.
But we already did more, Richard.
It was called "The platform."
And it was exactly what you wanted to make,
and it fucking failed, okay?
I'm sorry, but it's bad enough
that we can't get any funding because of you.
You're killing us out there.
Don't also sabotage us in here, too.
Pied Piper is a video chat company.
Get your head around that.
I'm quite certain I've never said this before.
I agree with Dinesh.
Well.
Well, that was just a whole heap of fun.
Ordinarily, I loathe coming to China,
but when you close a deal like that,
it makes the whole trip a delight.
Champagne, gentlemen?
I think that's very much in order.
I know you don't toot your own horn,
so I'll do it for you.
Here to you, Jack,
and to your Hooli/Endframe box
becoming the most successful American data storage appliance
to ever be manufactured in China.
Toot-toot.
Watch your back, Jeff Bezos, here comes Hooli.
All right, gentlemen... our flight today
from Shanghai to Moffett Field in Mountain View
will be just over 11 hours, so if you'll just--
Oh, actually, I was headed up to Jackson Hole,
see the wife and kids.
I-- I was gonna charter up tomorrow,
but maybe you could ask the boys
just to drop me off on the way?
Save me the trouble?
Of course.
Well, and I mean, it's really not a big deal,
but since we are headed east, I think Jackson is further.
Maybe we'll head to Moffett first,
then have the guys hop you onto Jackson, okay?
Well-- Well, actually, on flights like this,
the boys like to go over the Pole,
so that, technically, is a little more north to south,
and Jackson is quite a bit further north.
So I think, maybe, just go to Jackson first,
then head on off to Moffett. That sound good?
- Of course. - Great.
I'm gonna get a pillow.
You know what we desperately need is a palapa.
A ploppa?
A palapa.
It's a Mexican structure with palm fronds.
It's essentially a gazebo,
but spicier and with a south- of-the-border kind of vibe.
I think it would make us feel less exposed.
And generally, I think it would be good for morale.
Speaking of which, morale has not exactly been skyrocketing.
So, we need to get this cap table done tout de suite.
Richard and the fellows
are entitled to 40 percent of the company.
Now, if we each give 20 percent,
we would still own 30 percent each.
That seems fair.
Seems totally fair to me.
Dad?
Nope. Not gonna happen.
Mr. Bighetti, with all due respect, I--
If you had any respect,
you wouldn't have talked my son into wasting his money...
again.
My son's not giving up one share.
Not now, not ever.
Mr. Bighetti, if you're going to
control your son's board seat,
these decisions have to be unanimous.
- You're going to kill this comp-- - i don't care.
In my eyes, the company is already dead.
Killed by you.
That's my edge.
If all I accomplish by doing this
is making you as miserable as you've made me
watching you fleece my son,
then I'm okay with that.
He seems okay with that.
So you expect me to give the 40 percent
to the gents from my 50 percent,
effectively leaving me with 10 percent?
Yes.
No. No, no, no.
Then I would've invested 500 thou-- a half of a million dollars
just to end up where I started?
Unacceptable.
I can accept that.
I'm going to bed.
Good night, Brown Bear.
Love you, Papa Bear.
Goddamn motherfucker.
I mean, the guys are right. I'm fucking up the company.
I'm not helping in any way.
You're certainly not helping your cuticles by biting on them.
Your nail beds are gonna get infected.
Where'd you learn how to do this, anyway?
When I was on the street, it was a means of survival.
I don't know, it's just that...
I mean, I almost killed us,
the company, and that is so selfish.
I mean, if we have to get a million users,
I need to get us funding, right now.
How? We've already been turned down
by every respectable VC in town.
Who said anything about... respectable?
Oh, Richard, no.
Fuck yes, I want to talk business. What's the play?
Let's fuck this thing right in the pussy.
Thanks for meeting me here.
My fucking nanny got another DUI and lost her license,
and I'm stuck picking up my own kid like an asshole. So what's up?
Well, I know you wanted to buy Erlich's Pied Piper shares
back in the previous iteration, the platform.
Well, I was hoping you would want to come on
as a follow-on investor for the current platform.
The video chat?
Yeah. It's got a great tech. We're growing like crazy.
In fact, that's why we need funding,
to keep up with the users,
and I think it could be
really good if we could just keep it going.
No, you don't.
What?
You don't like it.
You don't believe in this product you're selling.
Russ, no, that's-- It's a good, sound business.
As I said, the tech is great
and all the guys are really behind it.
But you're not behind it, Richard.
I can tell, and as much as you want to be, you're not.
It's like this.
You're trying to date a woman,
but deep down in your heart you know you're gay.
Deep in your soul, you know you would rather be plowing a dude!
I don't-- I do-- Okay, what dude?
It could be any dude, as long as you really want to fuck him.
It could be a-- a twink, a bear,
an otter, a circuit queen, a chub, a pup, a gipster,
a daddy chaser, a leather man, a ladyboy, a Donald Duck.
Donald Duck's a gay guy who's been kicked out of the Navy.
H-How do you know so many gay things?
My grandfather just came out of the closet.
Beautiful. Very inspiring.
But the point is, if you're gonna spend all day fucking,
shouldn't Pied Piper be a dude you wanna fuck?
All right. Let's do an exercise.
You've got unlimited time and resources,
you can build anything in the world
you want with your compression,
anything at all, what's it gonna be?
Three, two, one, go. Go, go, go.
- You said I have unlimited time? - Now. Now, now!
A new Internet.
What? Why?
Okay. Well, I haven't really thought this through, so...
Okay.
- I own a telescope... - Of course you do.
...and I brought it out one night to look at the full moon.
- Of course you did. - And I got to thinking...
"Wow, we put a man on the moon
using the computing power of a handheld calculator."
And then I thought, "Okay...
"There's literally millions of times
"more computing power in my phone
and that's just sitting in my pocket doing nothing." Right?
So then I thought, there's, what, billions of phones
all around the world with the same computing power
just sitting in people's pockets.
So then I thought, "What if we use all those phones
to build a massive network?"
And here's the kicker: We use my compression algorithm
to make everything small and efficient
to move things around, and...
if we could do it...
we could build a completely decentralized version
of our current Internet, with no firewalls,
no tolls, no government regulation, no spying.
Information...
would be totally free in every sense of the word.
You wanna build a new Internet?
- Yeah, it's-- - Richard, I like it.
That I would fund.
Well, I-I-- I don't know if it's possible, and--
Look, if this new Internet is the man of your dreams
and this is the man that you wanna fuck,
then you need to fuck him.
That man I will pay you to fuck.
Where the fuck is that kid?
Wait a minute.
Aw, shit.
They kicked us out of this place.
I'm at the wrong fucking school.
Richard, you find that man, fuck him good.
Careful please. He's gonna peel out.
Monica, I need to--
You're not...
Monica? No. Thank God.
I'm Ed Chen.
Laurie put me in the good office
and moved Monica down the hall.
Way down the hall.
Okay. Sorry.
You're gonna listen to Russ Hanneman?
Richard, you sound like a crazy person.
I know, but-- but Russ is right.
I mean, I hate the video chat. I really do.
What?
You can see right into the--
Yeah, I'm very aware.
Laurie is punishing me for taking your side
and going against her, so she moved me down here
and gave my office to that little
brownnosing shit, Ed Chen.
Anyway, Richard, you're not gonna seriously go home
and tell the guys in your company
that even though your user rates are skyrocketing
that you wanna pivot.
For the past 48 hours,
I've been trying to rewrite the core video chat code,
and I literally can't.
Instead of typing, I just bite my fingernails.
I think, subconsciously,
I would rather bite my own fingers off
than work on this platform.
Richard, I know people who have spent
their entire careers chasing after an app
with this kind of growth rate and never hit it.
It's a really good product.
That may be, but it's not for me.
And look, I know these guys are my friends,
but they're also my employees, and it's my company.
So... if I say we have to pivot, we pivot.
Okay. I-I-- I have to go.
All right. Well, if you're sure,
then tell them and then call me and tell--
What? No, I-- I have to go.
There's another men's room on the fourth floor.
Right. 'Cause then you would've seen mine twice.
I mean, we're all thinking it, right?
Richard is fucking with a product that is working.
He should not be the CEO of this company.
I understand your concerns,
but is this the time that we fire Richard?
Is this the moment that I become the CEO?
You? Why you?
It's a simple process of elimination.
Gilfoyle, as an anarchist
would never accept a position of authority
- in any official organization. - None.
And you, of course, are out of the picture,
because Gilfoyle would never allow it.
Yeah, that's true.
And Jared, he'd sooner commit hara-kiri than...
replace little baby Richard.
So that leaves me.
And honestly, gents, who would you rather have
defending your four percent stake in the company...
- Five. - What?
- Five percent. - You said four. Was it...
You said three, and then you had...
- No, it's five. - Five.
You know what? I'm gonna back channel,
look at some notes, and we'll get to it.
In the meantime, if and when...
we are to depose Richard, I am his obvious heir.
Erlich, no offense,
but the board is you, Richard, and my dad, right?
So, I think that means you and my dad
would have to agree on who replaces Richard,
and pretty sure my dad would, like, never approve you.
- It's just not gonna happen. - Thank you.
- Yeah. - There is someone else.
Someone who has zero strikes against him.
Someone who has held high-level positions
at one of the biggest tech companies in the Valley.
Someone who's been on the cover
of one of the most prestigious tech publications in the world.
He sounds awesome.
Could we get him?
And as of now, we've got the votes...
of enough key Malaysian ministers
to proceed with construction,
but that support is time-critical.
Carol's right.
We'd have to break ground before monsoon season
or else the entire project could collapse.
So, what do you think?
Sorry. About what?
About the factory.
The factory.
The factory...
Excuse me for a moment.
- So, what have you got? - Well, sir, I did as you asked.
I flew the company plane to Shanghai,
then Moffett, then Jackson Hole.
Then I flew back to Shanghai, then to Jackson Hole,
then to Moffett, which is where I just landed.
- And? - Moffett is 28.3 minutes closer.
I fucking knew it!
Barker should've dropped you off first, sir.
Wait. What about headwinds or storm activity?
I don't want to give him any room to wriggle out of this.
Here's what I'm gonna need you to do.
Fly each leg five more times and average them.
It's the only way to be sure.
And we're not concerned with the expense
of 20 more private transcontinental flights?
Of course we are.
Jack Barker is costing the shareholders of this company a fortune,
and he must be stopped.
I'll go back to Moffett right now.
Good. Call me each time you're in Shanghai.
- I'll see you in a week. - Yes, sir.
Guys?
Shit, he came in the back.
Richard, we need to talk.
Well, actually, let me just say something first here.
I don't think Pied Piper should be a video chat company.
The balls on you.
Richard, we've all decided you are out.
Big Head is in.
Not my call.
Richard, we just can't keep fucking pivoting.
- We won't do it again. - Just wait for a second, okay?
Just-- You're not getting it. Please.
Uh, I'm quitting.
Wait. What?
Richard, I was waiting out front!
They want to ambush you and replace you with Big Head,
but I had nothing to do with it.
Again, not my call.
I was ready to fight you guys,
but then, on the way home, it occurred to me
there might be a better way.
I'm going to start my own company.
I will give up all of my equity in the video chat
if I get to completely own my algorithm.
I will grant you guys a perpetual license
to use the algorithm in your video chat,
but I need the algorithm to build something else.
And look, forget a million users,
with me out of the company,
you guys would be able to raise money, no problem.
And that way, everybody wins.
So we can use the algorithm,
free and clear, for video chat?
- Yes. - I mean, we-- we shouldn't even be talking about this.
And you would leave behind your 25 percent,
thus giving me enough equity to compensate the boys fairly
and Big Head's father would retain his 50 percent?
I think that's right. Yes.
And I would own 10 percent of your new company.
Wait. What? Why?
The algorithm was developed here in the Incubator.
Richard, shame on you.
Well, dealbreaker. Let's-- Should we get some food?
No, no. That's okay. It's fine.
And I'm here for advice,
or advice for the new CEO, whoever that may be.
To wit, uh...
I know it's probably not my place to give this suggestion,
but I think it should be Dinesh.
- What? - What?
- What? - What?
- Yeah. Sorry, Big Head. - What?
Yeah. Dinesh, you were the one that hacked together
the video chat in the first place.
You know the product inside and out.
You are the horse that I would bet on.
You really think so?
I do.
I'm down. Gilfoyle?
Gilfoyle,
can I please be CEO of Pied Piper?
Spoken like a true leader.
But since your failure as a leader is a virtual certainty,
tolerating your short reign as CEO
in exchange for a front-row seat to the disaster seems fair.
Plus, if I'm wrong, which I'm not...
I get rich. So I'm down with it, Dinesh.
Jared, what do you think about this?
I think this is crazy.
I left my job at Hooli to-- to come work with you, Richard.
And-- and now you're leaving?
Look, these guys, they're gonna need you,
so if you want to support me, you support them.
Think you can do that?
I've always been very adept
at taking the shape of whatever shoe was pressed down upon me,
so I can try to make it work.
Then it's settled.
Dinesh is the new CEO of Pied Piper.
Actually, just one last thing.
I think you guys should call yourselves PiperChat.
I'm gonna have to insist that I keep the name Pied Piper,
and I won't budge on that.
- Yeah, it's totally fine. - Okay, yeah.
- That's fine. - Who gives a shit? Terrible fucking name.
Let's get to work.
Congratulations.
So, wait. I don't have to be CEO, right?
Dinesh is going to do that?
All right. Let's figure out how this gets split up.
Jared...
Go.
Go on, man.
Get out of here.
Dinesh, you'll get five percent.
Gilfoyle, five percent.
- Jared, five percent. - Yeah. Okay,
so we all get five, not four.
Now you said-- you said four?
No, five. I said five.
Jared, can we get five more engineers?
That's-- That would come out of Jared's percentage.
No.
You wanted to see me, Skipper?
I did indeed.
Jack, I appreciate everything you've done
in your position as head of the Hooli/Endframe box,
but I think the company's needs are better suited
if I move you elsewhere.
Really?
Well, I appreciate the vote of confidence, GB.
I'm flattered.
Frankly, little bit surprised.
Why would you be surprised?
Can you think of any reason why you don't deserve a promotion?
I mean, anything at all?
I don't want to hurt my arm patting myself on the back,
but... right off the top of my head...
No, I guess not.
I mean, you've always been straight with me, right?
Straight to the point.
I sure have.
And you've always gone out of your way for me, yes?
Always put me first? Gone the extra mile?
Gosh... I sure tried.
Did you?
All right, Jack.
Professor. Gary in HR will set you up.
Enjoy your new offices.
Thank you, sir.
Would you like to see your desk?
Okay.
Here it is.
This is your desk.
So as you can see, since I became the CEO,
our user growth, undeniable.
Our retention, so sticky, it's pornographic.
We're lean, we're exploding,
and we're more mission-focused than ever
in providing the best video chat
the world has ever seen.
Well, this seems really promising, gentlemen.
Promising, indeed.
I think if each-- "Promising"?
You're a young associate here, so I'm gonna help you out, okay?
We have a lot of these meetings set up.
We will be fine.
What he means by that is...
But you...
you don't wanna be known around here
as the guy who fucked this up, okay?
So when you hip your bosses to our numbers
and they get visible hard-ons,
have them move quickly.
Erlich, you're with me.
-It's "Hards-on." -What?
"Hards-on" Not "Hard-ons."
It's a syntactical error that I could've remedied
if you had just given me the space to speak.
Erlich, seeing you Thursday, right?
You better believe it.
Can't wait for it. For, uh...
For Jian Yang's pitch. His new idea sounds super exciting.
Yes, well, he is... white hot right now.
And that's why I had him reach out directly,
and we can't wait to pitch you the idea
that is gonna be pitched to you.
Great. I'll see you then.
You have no idea what it is, do you? Not a fucking clue.
Always blue! Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue!
Always blue! Always blue! Always blue!
Always bl--
Richard, hey.
What's, uh... Ah, there we go.
What's going on? You... celebrating something?
We were just... chanting.
Why? What, the pitches go well?
They went fine, you could say.
You said they went awesome.
All right, thank you, Big Head.
I mean, I did get us a... few offers.
"We" Did receive more than a few offers,
as "few" often refers to three.
And today, we're four for four.
Which... I mean, what does that even mean?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Look, you don't have to do this.
Really. It was my choice to leave the company,
and besides, my Internet thing is going great.
Really, it's going very well.
So I want you to succeed, and I want you guys to be happy.
Sure you do, slugger.
Stop. Really.
It's cool. I mean that, totally honestly.
Keep it positive.
I should go Skype my dad, I think, and tell him the good news.
Um, it is good news, though, right?
'Cause we were all sort of like happy and celebrating,
- but now-- now it feels sort of weird and-- - Just go, Big Head.
- Okay. It's good? - Yes.
All right. Well... enjoy.
Carry on. Always blue.
Jared. Okay.
- Always blue. Always blue. - Sorry. Sorry.
Dinesh, I think you accidentally disabled my access keys
for the video chat data repository.
No, actually, I deleted them on purpose.
I purged all our ex-employees.
Gleb, Sanjay, Elisabet, you.
Gleb? What, you're comparing me to Gleb?
When we agreed to split the company, we said that
you could take the algorithm for your video chat,
and I could use the data flowing through the system
to optimize the algorithm for my thing.
- We had a deal. - We had an agreement,
not technically a deal.
What the fuck, Dinesh?
Play! Play! Blue, blue! Always blue! Always blue!
Have fun, you're having a party. You got pizza and everything.
- Always blue. - So, what?
I should've got it in writing, Dinesh? Is that it?
You wanna lawyer up now?
You know, we're just some guys in a house.
But I don't wanna be just guys in a house, Richard.
That's the whole point. I want PiperChat to be a real company.
And after all the bullshit we went through, no offense,
I finally got some real financing lined up for us.
I cannot have another Intersite on my hands.
That was fucking Russ and his shitty tequila.
You know that, man? You were there. That wasn't me.
Richard, it happened on your watch.
I'm sorry. I really am.
But the answer is no.
Okay, well, suck a dick.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
- Nice blazer. - Thank you.
- Where'd you get it? - Does it matter?
I just want to know where I can get one,
so I can look like a total fucking douchebag.
Wow, right?
Unbelievable.
Gents, why don't we take this...
party outside?
Yes, we live in California.
We should take advantage of it.
Okay.
Gavin, you told me to interrupt
if Jack Barker came to see you. I'm sorry.
Yes. Send him in.
I thought Barker would crack after one day in that basement.
The fact that it's taken him two weeks to fess up
about hijacking my fucking plane and resign
will make it all the sweeter.
Hiya, Skipper.
Sorry to barge in. I owe you an apology.
Really? Whatever for?
When you stuck me in that basement,
I was like, "Jack,
what the hell did you do wrong?"
And I'm sorry that it took me so long
to get it through my thick skull.
I finally figured out what this is all about.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
You are doing exactly what Bobby Iger does over at Disney.
What?
He makes every manager spend
one day of the year in the Goofy Suit.
Because sometimes, you just gotta be at product level
to be able to see the best path forward.
And once I realized that, it was like, ka-pow!
It was so obvious. It's the algorithm.
Pied Piper put middle-out in their vid chat,
and it's amazing now, I know.
I'm on it all the time with my grandkids.
We could use middle-out
to revamp our entire suite of products.
We can make billions, Chief.
I'm whipping up some proposals right now
that are gonna knock that wig right off your head.
Yeah.
What the fuck is he up to?
Look like a fucking wig to you?
The point is, Jian-Yang, you don't set pitches.
I handle the scheduling.
That's the symbiosis of our relationship.
- No. - What do you mean, "No"?
- No. - Jian-Yang,
PiperChat has some real heat, okay?
And we can draft off of that,
but it has to be a carefully choreographed dance.
You can't just wiggle your little tush
and expect every VC in the Valley to get hards-on.
I am your lead investor,
you will respect me as such.
I do not respect you.
You're not any kind of investor. You own nothing.
I own 10 percent.
You live in my incubator.
No, you evict me,
I evict your 10 percent.
What are you talking about?
"Santa Clara Sheriff's Department.
"Vacate or be forcibly removed."
To be fair, Jian-Yang, I filed this when I had no expectations
- that the system would work. - Okay.
Jian-Yang, just tell me-- can you just tell me what the idea is,
so I can gauge how aggressively I should pursue it?
Hey, Jared, you were there, right?
When we split the company into two,
Dinesh and I had a very-- - Stop, stop.
Please stop.
- Richard, what're you doing? - What? What?
- What do you mean? - I'm complaining about Dinesh.
He-- he sucks.
He's my boss now, Richard.
Well, your boss is being a real prick.
Richard, we have to bifurcate our relationship.
You and I can no longer discuss business. All right?
We can-- We can talk about
anything else two guys might talk about.
We can talk about sports teams
and their scores, or pussy,
but-- but you and I cannot and will not discuss business.
Hey, man, for what it's worth,
I thought it was super fucked up what Dinesh did.
I know what it's like
to be the one guy not in the company.
- You know? - So...
If you want my log-in, it's all yours.
Really?
- Yeah, man. - Thanks.
You know what?
I shouldn't do this. Dinesh said no.
And also, these are "Skyrim" cheat codes.
Oh, shit. Yeah.
Hey, my Bloomberg interview is on!
How did I come up with PiperChat?
That's a very good question.
I guess the tech Gods were just speaking through me.
Somehow,
I knew to take the best parts of a service
as substandard and crappy as HooliChat and make it--
How do I put this?
Incredible.
Do you think I have too much product in my hair?
No, I think you should use more.
Wait. Are you saying that because you think I look ridiculous
and you want me to look more ridiculous next time?
Which answer will get more of that stuff in your hair?
...but let's just say...
Wait, wait, wait. Watch this.
This is where I make Emily Chang laugh.
Quite a turnaround for a company
that wasn't exactly soaring.
Oh, it was soaring, Emily...
right into a clogged toilet.
And not just like a standard clogged toilet.
Like, I don't need a plunger.
I need a shovel and a bucket.
But enough about the previous leadership,
which was inept, lame, bitter...
Fuck him. We had a deal.
Thanks.
That's weird.
Hey, Richard.
Have you seen the new Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition?
The cover model has the most lovely, enigmatic facial expression.
Jared, I-- I don't really want to talk about guy talk.
I'm here to tell you that
I think Dinesh may be in some serious trouble.
Okay, so I was analyzing a bunch of user data,
- and I noticed-- - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Richard. Richard.
I told you, I can't talk about this. You have to bifurcate.
No, Jared, listen, you're gonna wanna hear this.
Wait. What do you mean you were looking at user data?
You violated our system?
Richard, you were inside us?
Don't tell Dinesh, and don't tell any of the other guys, okay?
"Don't tell Dinesh"?
Richard, Dinesh is my CEO.
Oh, God. What are you doing to me?
Did I make you angry?
I'm trying to save his ass, okay? I'm trying to save you.
Just survey the users...
and make sure you ask how old they are.
Okay? And then, that's it. That's it. That's it. No more.
Stupid fucking Jian-Yang and his shitty app.
I don't even know if it is shitty.
Hey, you know, I could probably find out about Jian-Yang's app.
He asked if he could practice-pitch it to me.
- Do you have any nines? - Go fish.
Wait. This could be great. What time are you guys doing that?
- I could listen in. - I don't know.
He asked if he could pitch me, and I said sure,
and then he kind of just like kept talking for a while.
You don't think that could've been the pitch, do you?
God damn it, what did he say?
Geez, I kind of zoned out.
Shit. Fives?
Uh, go fish.
Wait. I don't know if this would be relevant,
but he did say the word "Oculus" a whole bunch.
Wait. "Oculus"?
Oh, my God. It's a VR play.
That's the frothiest space in the Valley right now.
Nobody understands it, but everybody wants in.
Any idiot can walk into a fucking room,
utter the letters "V" And "R,"
And VCs will hurl bricks of cash at him.
Then by the time they find out that it's vaporware,
it's too late.
I have got... to get in on this.
Trust me. Just give me five minutes. There he is.
Hey! Wait. Is that our lawyer?
Hey! I thought he was in jail.
Hey. Perfect timing.
I just completed the detailing on this Kia.
- Come on. - What the fuck is going on?
Wait. I don't understand.
How did Richard have access to our user data?
Someone must've let him in.
It was you. You're a fucking rat, Jared.
Richard entered us without consent.
In spite of that, he has raised a real issue here.
Fuck this. I'm gonna Uber home.
Mr. Monahan, good luck with this whole work-release situation,
but I have more important things to do.
Mr. Chugtai.
It appears that 33 percent of your users are under the age of 13.
It's also apparent that you have
no parental permission requirements in place.
You're going to want to sit down for this.
- Are you familiar with COPPA? - Who?
That's the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act.
This Act establishes strict guidelines
to protect the privacy
of younger children on the Internet.
You are in gross violation of this act.
You know how kids can't have a YouTube or Facebook account
till they're 13? It's because of this.
Yes, but our users are chatting with each other, Jared,
not some old creep.
- No offense. - None taken.
My shame will linger even after my voting rights are restored.
Now, are there records
of these chats on your server?
Yeah, we store everything.
- What - Okay. What's going on? How serious is this?
Each violation of COPPA...
carries a penalty of $16,000.
So we're fined $16,000?
Oh, no. I hope they take cash.
$16,000 per user.
Not only each user...
each use.
Fifty-one thousand estimated underage users
times an average 25.6 chat sessions per user
times $16,000...
$21 billion?
I mean, how is that even fucking possible?
I mean, I knew Dinesh was going to fuck this all up,
but honestly, this couldn't get any better.
What's with the shirt?
He sort of became ill on himself.
I was wrong. This just got better.
This is all your fault, Richard.
This was your company before it was mine.
What are you talking about?
Dinesh, I specifically reminded you
to port over the terms of service from the platform.
Right, and I asked if you'd done it, and-- and you said you had.
Okay. I checked the TOS box when I submitted to the app store,
but then I didn't end up doing it, all right?
And then when we caught fire,
the last thing I wanted to do
was bog our users down with legal bullshit, you know?
I mean, nobody reads that stuff anyway.
Well, first of all, everyone reads the terms of service,
and secondly, they would've
given us legal cover from exactly this.
Every sound is $16,000.
Fuck!
All right, all right. Don't think about that.
Just think about how to solve this massive, massive problem.
Quickly.
- Quick as you can. - Jared! Just...
Wait. We could shut down.
No, no, no. Not when we're this close to signing a term sheet.
And in case all of you gents have forgotten,
I'm on the hook for half a million clambos for this thing.
But we can't stay online! We're just racking up more fines!
Well, technically, this is a corporation.
So whatever they fine you,
they'll really only be able to collect what the company's worth,
which at this point, is basically nothing.
That's right. I'm just the CEO.
I'm not personally liable.
Although...
Although what?
Well, when you lied to me about adding terms of service,
it could be argued you violated
your fiduciary duty to the company,
rendering you personally liable.
I mean, if the FTC brought us to trial,
I could be compelled to testify against you.
Jared, I trusted you.
Trust has nothing to do with it,
but thanks for making that official.
So I could be personally liable for $21 billion?
Yeah, most likely.
I know, in the fable, Pied Piper led all the children
into darkness, but now we're doing it.
So, what do you wanna do?
I'm gonna throw up again.
I'm going to watch this.
I want full surveillance on Jack Barker, 24/7.
I don't recommend using conventional listening devices.
He may sweep for those.
I do have a colleague at Facebook that has a laser microphone.
You can point it at an office window from a mile away
and read the sound vibrations.
I like it.
Hoover, you're the only person
I can trust at this goddamn company.
It's good to have a friend.
I understand that, sir.
Gavin, there you are.
I don't want to interrupt your talking with Hoover...
and talking and talking about things,
but I have some concrete news.
- Regarding? - Jack Barker.
By forgoing Western gadgetry,
simply stationing myself in the hall outside of his office,
I was able to overhear him speaking
of his plans to move against you.
He even referred to you as "Gavin... Smellson."
I knew it! Good work, Denpok.
Good work. Let's go slice this bastard in half, huh?
Hold on. We need proof.
Otherwise, he'll just deny it,
and it'll just be a case of he said/she said.
That's a good point. Denpok, who was he talking to?
Alas, I could not see this from my hidden vantage point.
I'll check the logs and see who was in his office.
No, because...
no one was there.
I'm confused. Was he on the phone?
Yes. Very perceptive.
- Easy. I'll just pull up his phone records. - No.
Not the phone phone.
So what was he doing? Was he video chatting?
That's what it was, chela.
Even better. I'll pull up the chat data.
You can do that?
Well, as long as he was on HooliChat,
but the bastard kept
grinding in my face how much he loved PiperChat.
- What if he was using... - PiperChat. Yes.
- Fuck! - He said the resolution
was so vivid and superior to HooliChat.
Sadly, now we'll never know the identity of the person
with whom he was definitely talking.
- Unless... - Unless what?
Dinesh?
Hey, man.
How's it going?
Bad.
Well, look, I've been there, man.
- No, you haven't. - No, I-- I have.
One time when we were pitching at Ross Loma...
I threw up in my pants.
Don't you mean "On"?
No. No, I mean-- I mean "In."
We were pitching and... well, things weren't really going well,
I was getting nervous and-- I don't know,
I think I must've eaten something bad that day.
Anyway, my stomach was upside down,
so I made a beeline to the stall.
But then I pulled down my pants, sat down...
but instead of shit, I threw up... into my pants.
Well, I was CEO for 11 days,
and in that time I violated the rights
of 50,000 little girls,
exposed them to sexual predators,
and racked up fines the size of a small nation's GDP.
Yeah. I threw up in my pants.
Fuck.
What do I do, Richard?
There are no right answers.
You know, when I was CEO...
I found that it was more about choosing
the one wrong answer that you can live with.
I really loved that video chat.
Hello.
This is he.
What?
It's Gavin Belson.
It's Gavin fucking Belson.
Hey, Gavin Belson.
What's up? Oh, my God.
We're crushing it all the time.
I'm in a bathtub.
Yeah, of course. I'd love to. Bye.
He wants to meet me at Josephina's tonight.
Did I say yes?
Holy shit.
Gavin Belson wants to acquire PiperChat.
He made the same call to me
back when he wanted to make an offer for Pied Piper.
He could take this entire shitbomb
off Dinesh's hands? Where's the fun in that?
More importantly, I could get all my money back,
maybe even more. We could 10X this motherfucker, gents.
- Although... - Although what?
Well, I'm sorry to play the Cassandra again,
but Dinesh can't sell Gavin the company.
- Why not? - Why the fuck not?
It's due diligence. Gavin doesn't trust anyone.
When I worked for him, he tried to microchip me.
Before he finalized any acquisition,
his legal team would uncover our malfeasance.
They'd sniff out the user issue immediately.
And they'd probably turn you in, and you do not want that.
I mean, there's also the moral quandary.
Even if he could get away with it,
could Dinesh really sell the company, knowing it's basically
a Sizzler buffet for the sexually deranged?
Of course he could.
Because even if there is a one percent chance of success
and a 99 percent chance of failure and prison,
he will do the right thing and get me my money back.
I'm sorry, Erlich. I've made my decision.
I'm gonna say no to Gavin Belson...
shut it down, and just see what happens.
What the fuck, huh? What the fuck?
Jian Yang!
Hey, Gavin.
Well... Dinesh.
Thanks for coming.
Listen, Gavin. I've thought about it,
and if this is about you buying PiperChat--
I didn't come here today to buy your company.
You didn't?
No. I came to take it.
I thought I'd have to buy you out,
and I wanted to know what kind of CEO I'd be dealing with,
so I had my comms people pull your press,
like this interview you did with TechCrunch
where you described PiperChat as, and I quote,
"Exactly like HooliChat,
"but without the suck-ass parts," end quote.
Or the one you did with Emily Chang,
where you told her how you took "the best parts of HooliChat
"and made them less crappy."
I was about to throw you a massive acquisition deal,
and then I realized
you'd already publicly admitted to stealing my IP.
I hope you have a good lawyer.
He works at the car wash down the street.
What?
Look, Gavin, you do not want to do this.
- I can't explain exactly why. - Shut up.
This is not a negotiation.
If you fight me, I will win,
and I will fuck you in the tech business forever.
No one will hire you.
I'm taking PiperChat. By 8:00 a.m. tomorrow,
you will hand over to Hooli all your data and systems.
All your users will be converted to HooliChat users.
It will be like PiperChat never existed.
And what you get out of it is the chance to walk away
and try and get another job in this town.
You have five seconds to decide.
- Five, four... - Okay.
So we're in agreement.
For a 10 percent stake in your current venture,
you will receive full pool privileges,
more room in the crisper, and you may live in my home for...
For free.
For free for six months.
Fuck you. One year.
Fuck! Fine. Fine.
- It's a deal. - Deal.
Jian, I mean, your onerous terms not withstanding,
I'm very excited to be a part of your VR play.
VR
VR?
- VR, virtual reality. - Who's doing VR?
You are. That's what Big Head said.
This play has to do with the Oculus, right?
No. But he said that you said, "Oculus."
He said you kept saying it. "Oculus, Oculus, Oculus."
Octopus.
No.
No.
- Octopus? - It's a water animal.
I-- I know what an octopus is.
Just-- what does your application have to do with octopus?
Eight different ways to make a Chinese recipe, octopus.
So I just traded one year...
of free rent, full pool privileges,
and more room in the crisper
for an application that is just...
eight recipes for octopus?
Yes.
Hey, guys, they're ready.
What the fuck is this?
I went through every chat in his history.
They're all the same.
Perhaps it was another chat format.
Could you acquire Skype or FaceTime
and check them as well?
What?
Uh, Gavin, I'm-- I'm sorry.
I need to talk to you about this PiperChat acquisition.
I put together a panel of the most active users
you ported over from PiperChat.
Bear in mind, this group is representative
in terms of gender, race and, most importantly, age.
Now, who else thinks changing
to a HooliChat log-in is hella lame?
Madison, Allison, Jennifer,
Stephanie, Quinn, Ingrid, Kaylee...
- Oh, no. - Amber, Sarah, Janelle...
Carl. Now, Carl...
you said the new sign-in page made you nervous.
Did anyone else feel nervous?
Are these my favorite nail beds I've ever seen?
No, but they're fine.
Okay. You know, I-- I wasn't actually gonna come here.
But then, I thought, "You know what?
I could-- I could use a walk."
And, um, well, I've just been working on
this peer-to-peer Internet thing,
and well, I-- I think better when I walk.
If I'm gonna be thinking and walking,
I might as well walk somewhere specific.
Hey, when was the last time you slept?
Um... I don't know.
Well, I know I-- I was gonna sleep last night,
but, uh... I thought I had this solve
for this computational trust issue I've been working on,
but it turns out, I didn't have a solve.
But it was too late. I had already drank the whole pot of coffee.
Okay. Well, I'm busy. I've got to see patients all the time.
- What are you doing? - Sorry. I don't want to interrupt you.
Sorry, just-- just one second. I just had a quick thought.
Why are you writing it on there?
Well, I mean, you change these between every patient, right?
I guess I'm going to have to now.
You know, all the guys at the house,
they think I'm nuts, but I'm not nuts.
Hey, you know, they say that
after Alan Turing was chemically castrated,
he got a lot less annoying.
What was that?
Nothing. Just-- that's just something to think about.
Okay. Sure, yeah.
Pen, please.
Right, yeah.
Go ahead and pay the lady out front.
Cash is always appreciated.
Hmm. How the hell does this thing work?
Question for you.
What's better than octopus recipe?
Answer for you.
Eight recipes for octopus.
My grandmother gave me a family recipe
before she died in a horrible way.
Wait. What?
Sorry. We knew Jian-Yang's app was in the food space,
but we assumed that it was camera-based.
Like, you take a photo of food,
the app returns nutritional information, or recipes,
or how it was sourced.
Yeah, like Shazam for food.
Exactly. But this, I mean, this is--
Shazam... for food.
No, Shazam's not my vision.
Of course they know that you're not pitching Shazam.
That already exists.
This would be a Shazam... for food.
- No. - Sorry. Language barrier.
Do you speak Mandarin? Anybody? No?
- That's not Mandarin. - He's a stickler for the accent.
No, my app is seafood, like food...
- in the sea. - That you can see.
Oh, "see food." S-E-E food. Oh.
- SeeFood. - Now, that we like.
Seafood. It's like food in the sea.
Fuck.
Oh, Gavin. Gavin.
I heard about your PiperChat issue.
Those COPPA fines are no joke,
could be billions.
I'm acutely aware, Jack.
Listen, after all you've done for me--
bringing me into the Hooli sandbox, letting me play here--
what if, hypothetically,
I had a way to delete the underage accounts
and the chat data in question?
Hypothetically, I could blame it on a malfunction
of my Endframe/Box servers.
The board would have nothing to blame you for.
Jack, I'm speechless.
I'm embarrassed to say it,
but I was beginning to question your loyalty.
Well, you should've. I said it was hypothetical.
Didn't say I'd do it.
Why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Gavin?
Uh, you guys? Gavin Belson just got fired!
- Richard. - Wait. What?
Shit, that's huge.
"There are unconfirmed reports
that Belson violated Hooli protocol
in the acquisition of a company that contained toxic assets."
- Oh, that's us! - Oh, my God. Gavin's been fired?
Did you fall in the pool?
Oh, no. No, I didn't.
I was, um... I was dangling my feet in,
'cause it was cool and refreshing and just helping me think,
and then, since I was wet anyway,
I purposefully started to wade around in the pool.
Uh... But don't worry. No, I didn't fall in.
I, uh... I am not a spaz.
"Belson will be succeeded by 'Action' Jack Barker.
"A veteran tech CEO, Barker commented,
"'We at Hooli pledge to work
"with the Federal Trade Commission
"to resolve this matter and commit ourselves
to earning back the public trust.'"
Wow, Dinesh, you really stuck it to him.
Now they're pinning it all on Gavin.
- Holy shit. - Dude, you're moist.
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'll go and get a towel.
I mean, Dinesh, you're a... A giant slayer.
As long as he's the one taking the fall for these underage users.
I thought I'd have to, like, answer to Congress or something.
Yeah, that makes sense. You were worried sick about the wrath
of a bloated and inept bureaucracy,
but feel totally comfortable having crossed
a spiteful and vindictive megalomaniac with unlimited funds.
Shut up. Gavin wouldn't come after me personally.
I think you might be the first Pakistani man
to be killed by a drone inside the United States.
People don't have people killed in the Valley.
Not even Gavin Belson. Okay?
Right, Jared?
I-- I once saw him throw a sloth
down a flight of stairs after a presentation,
and he said it was an accident, but he had this look in his eyes.
I-- I can't rule it out.
"A legacy lost.
CEO and chief innovator Gavin Belson
exits Hooli."
The end of the Gavin Belson era.
And if all goes well,
it is the beginning of the era of Erlich Bachman
and his funky Asian dude friend Jian...
Jian? Jian-Yang!
Coleman Blair and Associates just offered us
a seed investment of $200,000
for the Shazam of food.
All we have to do is dazzle them with a demo on Monday,
and, uh, the check will--
What the fuck? Huh?
Is that my vintage Corona Club beach towel?
Yes. I was in the pool, but I got out.
That's a beach towel, not a pool--
Where were you? I was referring to you as my funky Asian friend.
The passenger door's all fucked up!
I told you, there's no demo.
I'm making my recipe app.
You're gonna walk away from $200,000?
You know who walks away from that kind of money, Jian-Yang?
Richard, a crazy person.
Crazy? No. Opposite.
He walked away from $10 million. Now look at him--
wet pants, stealing towels,
babbling about technical issues that he can't solve.
I am one computational trust issue away from solving this thing.
Is this how you wanna end up?
No. He's a cautionary tale.
Nope, not true. Not a cautionary tale.
Got a lot of work to do. I'll be in the pool. Not crazy.
- I mean, it's like, wow. - Richard...
Hey, Erlich. Just FYI.
I actually did some image recognition stuff on Nip Alert,
so maybe you could hire me to help on the demo,
'cause my dad's been, like, kinda on me lately
to, like, get a job or go to school 'cause...
'cause he's upset that I lost all that money on-- on PiperChat.
And then also, you helped me lose that 20 million on Bachmanity.
Big Head, um...
Jian-Yang's culture--
he's... Chinese--
won't allow him to accept outside help.
Oh, right, 'cause of Chinese.
Okay, well, that makes sense.
If either of you could aid
in the construction of this image recognition software,
I can pay you handsomely.
Five years at ASU, then you dropped out?
No degree?
Pretty solid "C's" in all of your CS classes.
Right.
But really more incompletes than anything.
Yeah, a lot of those classes were at 11:00 A.M., so...
I'm sorry, but I-- I don't think
you're Stanford CS material, Mr. Bighetti.
Yeah, that's totally fair. Thanks so much.
Have a nice day.
Oh, hey, did you get this at a party on Alcatraz?
- Yes. - Oh, cool. I got one there, too.
Or, I mean, I guess, technically, I bought one there.
I bought everything there.
Excuse me?
Oh, Bachmanity was my VC fund.
What?
- It stands for Venture Capital. - I know. Umm...
Wh--
Wait. Nelson Bighetti.
Were you on the cover of WIRED magazine?
Yeah, and actually inside, too.
Can I get you some coffee?
The last 24 hours have been very painful.
But in the days to come,
what I will be thinking of most is all of you,
the good people of Hooli, and what we've built together.
And, yes, we built great products here. Great products.
But I like to think we built an even greater connection.
So, in the spirit of that connection,
if any of you would like to say something to me--
positive or negative-- this is the time.
I encourage you to be completely honest.
Don't be shy.
This is most likely the last chance we have to talk.
Anything at all.
Ah. Here we go.
Todd, our senior systems engineer.
I'm sorry, but it's my official duty
to... escort you off the property...
I understand.
Thank you for your dedication--
...and relieve you of your badge.
Yes.
I guess this is it then.
Goodbye, Hoover.
Your parking hang tag.
I mean, do you think I'm crazy for chasing this thing?
Don't ask me. I'm hardly in a position to judge.
I mean, you do realize I'm
literally the only person in this entire grocery store
who's actually buying stuff for myself.
I don't know. Maybe these people are right.
Maybe I just drop this one, move on,
and become some pathetic fucking TaskRabbit, you know?
Hey, I have a family, asshole.
Oh. Sorry. Not you, the other ones.
Look, if you can't crack this idea, there's no shame.
I mean, a lot of really smart people have gotten stuck on it.
Please. Like who?
Peter Gregory for one.
Peter was thinking about a fully decentralized Internet?
Why wouldn't you mention this to me?
Well, because he walked away from it,
and you seemed so excited about it,
I thought you had a new angle.
I didn't want to discourage you.
Oh, what, 'cause I'm some delicate little flower?
I couldn't handle it?
The thing is, Peter tended to cling to things,
and he gave up on this. I mean, he must've had a reason.
Wait. Peter was a compulsive note-taker. Right?
What about his journals? I mean, do you guys still have them?
Richard, I am on thin ice as it is at Raviga.
No. Monica, listen to me, okay? I haven't slept in days.
I'm walking into pools fully clothed.
This is all I think about. Please.
Fine, but just this once.
Yes. Thank you.
- Fuck. It's Erlich. He... - What?
He wants me to help spin up this demo
for Jian-Yang's bullshit Shazam-for-food app.
Wait, the thing that Coleman Blair just bought?
That was them?
Yeah, but they haven't bought it yet.
I mean, they sign the deal on Monday,
but it's all contingent on a working demo,
which they do not and will not have.
Interesting.
Oh, you're doing great work by the way.
- Fuck you. - Definitely. Thank you.
I'll have those forms to you by 11.
Yeah, so it's called SeeFood,
but it's S-E-E Food, get it?
Yes, Erlich Bachman showed me a demo,
and this thing is incredible.
Yeah, and Coleman Blair
is gonna get the whole deal for only 200K.
But here's the thing, they don't close until Monday.
I mean, if I had Laurie's ear, I would tell her
that we should pay them today and close the deal,
and Bachman would jump on it in a second.
Go choke on that, broham.
Very funny.
What's funny?
This message. "Hey, I'm a big fan
"of what you did to Gavin Belson.
"I've seen your photo and think you're cute.
Would love to meet up. Mia."
- Fuck you. - I didn't send that.
- Oh, you didn't? - My hand to Satan.
But before you go ahead
and get a little brown boner in your pants,
you might wanna consider that it's not a woman.
I bet you're being catfished by Gavin himself.
Oh, fuck.
- But... - But what?
On the off chance that this is an actual real woman,
getting murdered seems like an acceptable risk.
Let me ask you something. Do you think wearing
the name of the college you're going to to class
is like the same thing as wearing the name of the band
you're going to to a concert?
- What? - Did you get into Stanford?
Yeah, and this is totally going to get my dad off my back,
and they said they liked my story,
so I'm gonna take a CS class there.
And they're so nice.
I was asking if it was gonna be pass/fail,
and they were like, "It's up to you."
And then I said, "Is there gonna be homework?"
And they were like, "Only if you want it."
And so then, I guess I have to decide if I want it,
which kinda already feels like homework,
but do you think I...
Holy shit.
It's like we just walked right into Peter Gregory's brain.
Actually, I think Peter's brain
is in a cryo-locker in Menlo Park.
I remember this photo from Peter's office.
It's still so weird to me
that he and Gavin Belson were ever friends.
Select destination.
No. No, no. No, thank you.
Optimizing route to Arallon.
Hold on.
Wait. Are all these Peter Gregory's notebooks?
Are they? Are they in this box?
Richard. Remember, you promised
you were gonna get some sleep tonight.
Yeah, I will.
All right, I'm, uh... I'm gonna leave you guys to it.
Oh, Erlich didn't get a call from Ed Chen today, did he?
Yeah. I heard them on speakerphone,
'cause Erlich was neti-potting.
I think, uh... I think they're meeting tonight.
Good to know.
- What? - Sesame seeds.
- To SeeFood. - To SeeFood
and to a full-expensed meal on Raviga's tab,
and to you, Ed Chen,
who pulled the wool over Laurie Bream's eyes
and got us two-hundo-thou sight unseen.
Well, she had some concerns
about getting into business with you again,
but I can pretty much talk that broad into anything.
Cheers to that.
You're a con man, like Erlich!
What does that mean?
It-- it's a little term of endearment we have around the house.
Uh, a confident man.
He sees me as a confident man, and he looks up to me.
You know, you have to be patient with him,
'cause he's a bit of a moron.
- Moron? - No, no, no.
I mean, he's-- Not in tech.
And how about this palapa? Are we in the islands or what?
Sorry. I--
This app isn't gonna suck, right?
If it sucks, it's my ass.
You guys have a working demo... right?
Uh, we're gonna slow down
on the, uh... the-the-- the servings for the little one.
So, he's from China, a small town,
not used to our big city liquor, and-- No, no, no, no, no.
Jian-Yang.
Boys, boys. Let's speak in English. It's the law.
"I'm a big fat fucking asshole."
Okay, now. That's-- that's me.
Why would I call myself a big fat asshole?
The liquor's gotten to the little fellow,
and I wouldn't listen to a word he has to say.
Gilfoyle. This is Mia.
Are you gonna murder Dinesh?
- No. - Bummer.
Wait. Gilfoyle?
Are you the Gilfoyle from Bovine Dawn?
Maybe.
I'm MI4.
No shit.
I always thought you were a fat, bald weirdo.
Well, she's not. She's a thin, hairy regular.
You know, you were totally wrong about the dump
of all the hacking team's best exploits.
No, if you look at what happened with the Equation Group,
it was basically the same thing.
She's right, you're wrong.
Um, shall we head out?
Don't wait up.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my fucking God! - Richard, what is it?
Jared, look. It's all here.
Peter Gregory knew the value
of a completely decentralized Internet.
I mean, look, look. "The Internet we deserve."
I mean, look, even back then,
Peter was worried that the Internet would become
this shitty corporate-controlled thing
that-- that Hooli and all these other companies manipulate today.
But the idea is real.
It's just that Peter didn't think it was feasible
unless compression surpassed the theoretical limit
of a 2.9 Weissman Score.
We shattered that limit at TechCrunch Disrupt.
Yeah, baby. Exactly.
I mean, Goddammit. I always knew
there was a perfect application for my algorithm.
These notes, all this-- this is going to save me months.
This is it. I mean, I was right all along. I was right!
Can I just... Can I try something?
Yeah.
- Okay. - I don't know.
- Sorry. - That's okay.
So... do you like movies?
Depends on the movie.
I'm the exact same way.
It being a movie doesn't mean I'm gonna like it.
Would you care for some wine or a cocktail tonight?
Uh, just water, please.
Just water, please.
I love water.
I do. Oceans, rivers...
lakes.
When does a pond become a lake?
I wonder if it's depth.
Where are those waters?
Felt like we ordered waters a while ago.
And-- What?
Fucking prick.
- What? - Oh, nothing.
It was just a text from Gilfoyle.
- Gilfoyle isn't a prick. - Yeah, I'm sorry.
He's a motherfucking prick.
- What? - That guy sucks.
Everyone hates him on the message boards.
You know, putting a face to the name made so much sense.
- Right, 'cause his face sucks, too. - Totally!
- Yeah. - I have to find this one post of his.
It was insane.
You know, he has no friends.
He pretends like he's all dry and witty,
but he's just a monotone piece of shit.
And being a Satanist just means you're ugly,
and you're leaning into it.
That's right.
You know what? Can I get a glass of Malbec?
Unless... do you want to get a bottle?
Yeah. Let's get a bottle of Malbec.
- Fucking Gilfoyle. - Right?
Mr. Bighetti.
- When you're ready. - Uh, ready for what?
I'm like the class clown already.
Why is my name on the board?
Oh, no.
Laurie, you wanted to see me?
Oh. Yes, Monica, sit.
Are you pregnant?
- Yes. - Congratulations.
- On? - On being pregnant.
Oh. Yes.
Friday afternoon, Ed Chen convinced me
to bid against Coleman Blair
on an app entitled SeeFood.
It's run by Bachman and the one who smoked in the offices.
Well, I-- Ed is very persuasive.
This morning, he made the case that
since you have a long-standing relationship with Bachman,
and since you are a talented VC who deserves a second chance--
his words-- you should take lead.
What?
I mean, look at this drawing.
I drew the exact same thing on my doctor's butt paper.
I mean, Peter had the exact same idea.
He was just waiting for compression to catch up,
which it did, thanks to me.
Cheer up, Richard.
Yes, but here's the best part, okay?
Peter never foresaw the ubiquity
of Internet connected computing devices. Right?
Camera, refrigerators, TVs, baby monitors,
not to mention the billions-plus smartphones
that are floating around the world.
I mean, who here has a smartphone, right?
You, you, me, Jian-Yang, Dinesh, Monica...
Richard, you don't have to name everyone you know.
Point is... you all thought I was crazy
when I walked into the swimming pool with my clothes on,
but it turns out I was fucking right.
Okay. So, not crazy. Opposite. You poor idiots.
How was school, Timmy?
Oh, not great. They made me teach.
- Teach what? - Stanford.
You're a professor at Stanford now, Big Head?
No, that would be crazy. I'm a guest lecturer.
What are you doing?
It was open, and you have the keys.
Strange. Did you change the locks?
'Cause the keys were working last night when I went for my date.
'Cause I haven't come back to the house since my date, so...
I did sex on her.
- Good. - Cool.
Yeah, that's great.
Nice, man. Who is she?
Her name is Mia, and she is a-Mia-zing.
She hates Gilfoyle almost as much as I do, so...
Huh! Jumping headlong into a sexual relationship with MI4.
Ballsy. But I'm sure you've thought through the consequences.
Well, we weren't really doing a lot of thinking.
You know what I mean?
- Oh, wow. - Mia is a legit hacker.
People say that she's taken on the Chinese government,
and here you are, after one meal,
in an intimate relationship.
So?
So what do you think she'll do if you try to break up with her?
Or disagree with her? Or disappoint her in any way,
like by confessing that your badass takedown of Gavin Belson
was a total accident?
Unless, you've already told her.
It didn't come up.
Well, I'm sure that when she finds out
that your entire relationship is based on a lie of omission,
she'll be very understanding.
So what? We just won't breakup.
Ever?
Ever.
Erlich.
Do you know how badly Ed Chen just
fucked me with Laurie?
Let me tell you something.
A threesome is always awkward, especially the first one.
Laurie being a little bit older--
I'm talking about SeeFood.
What do you and Jian-Yang have?
A whole lot of nothing.
Are you-- no. No, no, no, no, no.
SeeFood has to be great.
My job depends on it.
Ed Chen bailed and dumped the whole thing on me.
Richard, can I speak with you in the kitchen for a moment?
Yup. Sure.
So, what's up?
Well, here's the thing.
Remember that phone number you were curious about in here?
Well, it's not a phone number. It's a patent number.
A patent for exactly what you were planning to build.
So Peter patented it.
No, I, um...
- I spoke to Brian Fong. - Who?
Brian Fong.
And he told me that Peter was very excited about the idea,
but there was some resentment
that he wasn't focused more on what the team was working on,
so one of them went out and got a patent on it.
Why didn't this guy pursue it?
Well, the patent was just a roadblock to keep
Peter focused on the company they were starting...
a company that went on to be known as Hooli.
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Sst!
So you're telling me that
the perfect application of my algorithm
belongs to Gavin fucking Belson?
I'm afraid so.
Richard, are... you okay?
Uh, yes. Just putting something away.
Yep. Not crazy.
Opposite.
Richard, you gotta let me in. I have your shoe.
All right, I'm-- I'm sorry to barge in here,
but you have to eat something or you'll...
Hello?
It's Richard...
Hendricks. Richard Hendricks.
I'm here for Gavin Belson, and we really need to talk.
I know it's the middle of the night.
I really just need five minutes of your time.
Okay.
Holy shit. What happened?
I was working through some issues.
Mind the glass.
What the fuck is this?
It's a license...
for your peer-to-peer computer communication patent.
It's-- It's very standard stuff.
Essentially, in exchange for your patent,
you would get a royalty and equity
in the new company that I'm starting up.
So if you just,
sign there by the Post-It note,
and I will take it and leave,
and you will never see me again.
Are you joking?
Uh, well, I guess we could hang out.
Richard, stop talking.
I was just ousted from my own company,
a company I built from the ground up.
My legacy is in ashes.
Come on, I wouldn't... I wouldn't say that.
Well, The Wall Street Journal said that.
I lost everything because of something you did,
and you're here at 3:00 A.M. asking me for a favor?
Really? You're a mean person, Richard. Do you know that?
You are a bad guy.
No. No, no, no. I wouldn't say that.
I think, maybe,
what's happening is that you're just not understanding
the technology I'm trying to build here.
So now I'm stupid, too?
I know what the technology is, Richard.
I have a patent on it.
What the fuck is a matter with you?
So you're not gonna sign it?
No, I'm not gonna sign this!
Jesus! You're a fucking sadist, you know that?
You're demented!
I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it
just to watch you waste your fucking time.
This technology did not work when Peter theorized it,
and it doesn't work now.
It-It, um... It actually does work now.
- It does. - Oh, really?
When did the laws of physics change?
When I exceeded
the theoretical limit of compression at TechCrunch.
- You were there. - I know I was there!
Thank you for bringing up that very painful memory!
Okay.
Can I... Can I just...
- What? - ...draw on this?
Sure, why not? It's shattered, just like I am.
I read Peter's notes, all of them,
and he knew that a peer-to-peer Internet
was possible in the future,
but he was also basing that on,
what, old desktop computers.
He never, ever foresaw the ubiquity or power
of all of our modern-day smartphones.
He was also dealing with a completely different Weissman limit.
So... uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
What is that? Is that number correct?
The delta in mean device efficiency?
Yeah, it is.
See, eventually, over time,
this will render every server
that Hooli operates obsolete,
which would make Jack Barker shit himself.
- Holy shit! - You know what?
Actually, I'm gonna...
Welcome to the future, Gavin.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Son of a bitch! - I-- I'm sorry.
Dinesh, this front-end design looks great.
- Thank you. - Nice work.
What's in that?
That is a burrito for the test.
Good to know.
Let him have it.
Gilfoyle thought he was too good to work on SeeFood,
and now he's about to lose a fortune.
Okay. Ready for test.
After you, milady.
This is weird.
Mia just texted me "Good luck with the demo."
Did any of you guys tell her about this?
Your hacker girlfriend wouldn't happen to know
the model of our router, would she?
Yeah, actually, she... complimented your choice.
Why didn't you say anything?
Why would I tell you she said something nice about you?
Damn it.
We have to assume she's everywhere.
Okay. It's ready.
Please, God.
What would you say if I told you there is an app on the ma--
We're past that part! Just demo it.
Okay. Let's start with a hot dog.
Shit.
- Yes! Oh! - It works.
- Motherfuck! - Huzzah!
Jian-Yang, my beautiful little Asiatic friend,
I'm going to buy you the palapa of your life.
We will have 12 posts, braided palm leaves.
You'll never feel exposed again.
I'm gonna be rich.
Fuck you, Gilfoyle.
- Do pizza. - Yes, do pizza.
- Yeah. - Do pizza.
Pizza.
"Not hot dog"?
Wait. What the fuck?
That's-- that's it?
It only does hot dogs?
No, and "Not hot dog."
Give me that. Give it to me.
Jian-Yang. Motherfuck.
I gave you the ability to spin gold,
and instead, you've spun pubic hair with shit in it,
- and gravel and corn-- - Hold on, hold on.
Jian-Yang's actually put together a pretty good classifier.
You know? I mean, the core tech is valid.
It just... It just needs to be trained.
So, what he did for hot dogs,
he needs to repeat for every food in existence?
No, that's very boring work.
That's scraping the Internet for thousands of food pictures.
You can-- you can hire someone else.
We can't, because we just spent a big fat stack of cash
on little Dinesh over here.
And there are other expenses--
legal, marketing, operating fees,
those goddamn AWS charges.
Fucking Bezos.
And so, we do not have the funds
to hire scut workers to do your scraping for you.
And thus, you will scrape the Internet.
You and you alone.
I'm sorry, the time to back out
was before you signed the term sheet.
I'm gonna tell Laurie that this was a smashing success.
Go make it one.
Erlich was right. You are a white witch.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good. Yes, you are all here.
I think it's probably time we all had a chat.
About what?
Well, I'm pretty sure you're all...
wondering where I've been.
You were gone?
Yes, I was gone all week.
I saw you come out of the shower yesterday.
Okay. Well, obviously, I've been sleeping here at night,
but I've been gone during the day.
Pretty sure that shower was in the morning.
That's part of the day, Richard.
Okay, Gilfoyle, I-I-- I've been sleeping here at night,
and then I've been here for some mornings,
but I'm-- I've left the house during the day.
We all leave the house during the day, Richard.
That's not weird.
I went to get coffee this morning.
Yeah, I went to the dispensary,
and then I'd smoked the weed before I got home,
so I went back to the dispensary.
You know what?
I just realized I haven't left the house in six days.
Now that's worth exploring.
Okay, I get it. Look.
Every day this week, I have been...
at Gavin Belson's house.
What?
Gavin has offered to go into business together.
But, look, I just came there for the patent,
and he was the one who wanted to be full partners.
What did you say?
We talked about it,
and we agreed that it would be the best thing to do.
Good Lord. Richard... no.
Guys, look, I have the patent.
I also have funding
and real, genuine insight to the whole thing.
Let's not forget here that Gavin is
a co-founder of a bajillion-dollar tech company.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
When you don the skin of the beast,
the man within dies.
What is that? Nietzsche?
One of the boys at my group home always said that.
He died.
You're not pulling Dinesh off SeeFood.
And I am not leaving SeeFood
to go work for Gavin fucking Belson.
- I'm not asking you to. - You're not?
Guys, do you not remember the last time we talked
about us all working with Gavin Belson?
Gilfoyle, you told me to chortle your balls,
and everybody else walked out of the room.
I know how much you hate him,
which is exactly why I told Gavin
if we were gonna do this thing,
that you guys wouldn't be coming with.
So we have hired a recruiter to...
find people to replace you guys.
Even me?
Well, no.
You don't really need to be replaced.
True, I can't be replaced.
Well, when you left video chat,
you did keep the rights to the algorithm, so--
I mean, it's weird,
but I guess it's really none of our business.
It's my fucking business.
I now own ten percent--
Five percent, actually.
What?
Ten percent of my half of the company is five percent.
But, I mean, look,
your shares are gonna be worth a whole lot more
than they ever would,
now with the patent and Gavin being involved, so...
So then we're all good here, I guess, right?
I think that's right.
Weird.
All right. Well, thanks for understanding.
Uh, you're welcome.
I don't think we need to be afraid of the Wi-Fi.
It's pronounced "Wifey,"
and clearly you don't understand the threat level
of the person that you're sexually disappointing.
We're going hardwire.
What about for my phone?
You mean the thing that tracks your movement
and every interaction you have?
Literally, your fingerprint?
The second you're on Wi-Fi,
it's like you're leaving her alone with your phone.
So, actually leaving her alone with my phone...
that would be bad?
You fucking idiot.
I was in the bathroom.
For how long?
A while.
Really?
Who's that?
Richard's meeting with Brett Saxby.
From Hooli?
Formerly. The recruiter sent him over.
He's interviewing him for head of engineering.
Why? That guy sucks.
Why is Richard in there with Brett Saxby?
I mean, he was in Gavin's inner circle.
Is Richard aware of that?
Is anyone taking notes?
Does Richard even have a pen?
That is so funny.
It's 10 a.m.
Why are they drinking beer?
Because he sucks.
Did Dick say who else he was meeting with?
The recruiter sent him a whole big list right there.
Gonna be late for class.
How's that going?
It's okay. I'm just a little nervous
I might run out of material soon.
We already watched the Facebook movie,
A.I., The Net,
and half of Tron.
Which Tron?
What? No. Tron.
There's two Trons.
Shit. That's awesome.
It should get me through another week. Thanks.
This entire list is a shit show of shitheads.
Why would Richard trust a recruiter to source him recruits?
It doesn't make sense.
- What? - You guys seem like super invested
in who Richard hires to work with Gavin Belson, that's all.
Are you insinuating jealousy?
This is just concern for Richard's vision.
If Richard wants to saddle himself with mediocrity...
Go for it.
You did not.
I swear to God, bro. I swear to God.
Well, I'll tell you what.
Next time you bust out the old Sea-Doo,
give me a call.
Good. Guys, you know Brett.
Nope.
It's great to meet you guys.
We've met.
Okay. Well, it has been a pleasure.
I shall walk you to your car.
All right. Uh, After me.
I hate him.
Gentlemen, I just paid the palapa contractor.
The palapa piper, so to speak.
The dream is a reality.
We'll no longer be exposed... to the elements.
Hey, Erlich.
You wanna guess who's on this list of availables
that Richard just got from his recruiter?
Who?
Your boy, Jian-Yang.
What? What?
Jian-Yang!
You already have a fucking job, Jian-Yang.
You have to finish SeeFood.
Now get to food scraping.
I fucking hate SeeFood.
I have to look at different hot dogs.
There's Chinese hot dogs,
Polish hot dogs, Jewish hot dogs.
It fucking stupid.
Well, here. Here's one more for you.
See? "Hot dog." It doesn't even fucking work right.
Then you should hire someone using company money,
not build a roof over nothing.
The palapa was budgeted for, Jian-Yang.
That's what you do when you get funding,
you upscale your workspace to help with recruiting.
You just said you recruit no one.
Because we spent all the money on upscaling.
Why... Why is this so confusing?
You're stealing.
If you can steal, I can quit.
I have meetings at Periscope, Airbnb.
Good companies.
The fuck you do.
We still have $150,000 of Raviga's money left.
That's three months of burn.
So, until we are dick up and flat broke,
this is your life.
Get to it.
This is no life.
I want to live.
Erase that dick picture.
You've got mail.
Yes.
Those are very powerful words.
Sorry.
No, no. It's okay.
Your phone has technology inside it,
so you're double-learning.
Jian-Yang, what in the good fuck is that?
It's called business expense.
You buy a hut.
I... buy a car.
You say, "Keep doing SeeFood until money is gone."
Now, the money is gone.
Dick...
is up.
Where'd you get those sunglasses?
Did they come with the car?
These are from your mom.
Listen, Jian-Yang,
you can't just blow the rest of our runway on a Corvette.
Who's gonna scrape the Internet?
Twelve-speaker sound system.
It's very loud, very expensive.
The fuck was that?
Just three months of runway being driven off
by 90 pounds of asshole.
Spoken by a 280-pound pile of shit.
The fuck are you gonna do now?
Professor Bighetti, a word if you please?
Richard...
I know it's none of my business...
but I worked with that Brett Saxby fellow at Hooli.
He's a talented engineer,
but in an office environment,
he can be both tardy and fresh.
I'm-- I'm not hiring him.
He uses spaces not tabs.
I see. Okay.
Well, that's a relief.
But, Richard, what about the next Brett Saxby?
Or the Brett Saxby after that?
And even if you vet them all,
you are still in a room with Gavin.
So? We're partners. What's your point?
He and his-- his posse of-- of bandits and cutthroats
will turn on you in a second.
You need me...
the half-crazed, half-Apache
who will do anything to get your back.
I'll scalp Gavin if I have to,
and all the rest of those paleface sons of bitches.
I'll kill them with knives. I'll kill them with guns.
I'll kill them with my hands.
I'll talk them into suicide. It doesn't matter.
All right, Jared, I... I think what you're asking is...
you want a job?
If you think you can find a place for me--
Yeah, of course, Jared. Yeah.
You're more than welcome to work on this.
But just to be clear, you're not gonna stab anyone, are you?
It feels good to laugh.
So... So, that's a no then?
Richard.
So, we're not gonna finish the movie?
Yeah, sorry, but my colleague here was pretty adamant
that a better use of class time
might be to learn while accomplishing something.
Now take one, pass it all the way down.
We're supposed to scrape the Internet
for thousands of food images?
Yeah. So you'll find, like,
five or 30,000 pictures of your food,
and then put them in a folder with that food's name on it.
And it's good if you get, like,
weird angles or lighting of your food.
So it should be pretty fun.
So we're gathering training data
to run through a convolutional neural net.
Like an image classifier?
Who wants broccoli?
Broccolini for the ladies? Broccoli.
Just so you know, this does not mean I don't trust her.
I'm just doing this so you'll, like, shut up and leave me alone.
Mia, if you're listening, you're so pretty.
You're both headed to Gavin's?
Indeed we are. Together again.
Butch Cassidy and his head of business development.
Another Western reference.
Let's go.
- You know, he'd hire you, too. - What?
All you have to do is admit that you want the job.
And, like, get down on your knees and beg.
Says the guy who's romancing a woman
through a phone that isn't even on.
A woman that he described to me in private
as a skinny little fuck factory.
No, I didn't. God.
Mia, I would never do that.
Richard, Brett Saxby ran my
data analytics team for three years.
Respectfully, I think passing on him is a mistake.
Yes. Well, uh, I met with Brett Saxby,
and, um... to be honest...
To be honest, I don't-- I don't think he's our man.
Fair enough. There are plenty of good alternatives on this list.
Although, I'm a little confused
by your notes on some of these people.
"David Burnham. Annoying slob, fucked-up face.
I could write better Python with my asshole."
You know what? I think... I think you have my list.
Yes, I have a very weird shorthand.
Yeah.
Okay, next.
Becca Th--
No, guys, that goes in the-- the sunroom.
I'll show you. All right.
Back in a flash.
Come this way, gentlemen. Here.
God, there are pages of graphic insults here.
Fucking Gilfoyle. Right?
Richard, would you be open to having Gilfoyle on the team?
Well, yeah, of course. I mean, I'd hire him in a second,
but he'd never do it.
Richard, Gilfoyle is a man of intense pride.
So, when he refers to a potential employee
as a "Pig-faced fuck nose,"
what I hear is "I need to be needed."
Well, what I hear is "Pig-faced fuck nose."
Exactly. I mean, Gilfoyle's insults
are normally well crafted, almost poetic.
Last week, he referred to me as
"Frankenstein's bulimic daughter."
Yeah, I get what you mean.
So what do you want me to do, Jared, beg him?
Well, I... I think a little outreach
would be in the company's best interest.
Really? "Butt-dick"?
The man's in pain.
I know this system is super confusing,
but we don't see any completed assignments.
Cut the shit. Where's the work?
Well, we all got to talking the other day after class.
We couldn't figure out if you were, like, a TA
or why you were giving us assignments,
but we all agreed we didn't like the way
- that you were speaking to Professor Bighetti. - I'm used to it.
So we searched your name on PitchBook,
and that SeeFood app you got funded at Raviga popped up.
PitchBook? How do you have access to PitchBook?
Your idea was so simple.
It was like something you could come up with
in the room during a meeting.
Which is what Garrett from Coleman Blair told us
at the CS undergrad mixer on Friday.
Hey, Erlich.
Here I am. Class of '06.
- Go Cardinal. - Go Cardinal.
Anyways, we founded our own Shazam-for-food company,
- and he's funding us. - Mm-hmm.
- Whoa, congrats! - Wait, that's stealing.
No. It's exactly what Mark Zuckerberg did to the Winkle guy
in that Facebook movie Professor Bighetti had us watch.
And he was the hero of that film.
And with all of us working together,
we'll easily beat you to market.
So, that's how it goes, huh? Hmm?
You steal a man's idea, rendering his company worthless.
I've read a number of disparaging articles about your generation
in The Atlantic and Slate.Com summaries.
It's all true.
Trigger warning: fuck you!
Professor Bighetti, I'll see you at home.
You apologize?
In this case, yes, I apologize.
Who am I to advise you on your very valuable company?
It's time to let you go, like a bird.
So, go out there without me.
Make your recipe app. Take your meetings.
Live. That being said...
...since there's no cash to buy me out,
I propose this: allow me to keep the palapa
and give me the 'Vette.
You're cashing out?
Dinesh, stay out of this, please.
Car and hut for ten percent?
It's a palapa.
Okay. It's a deal.
You know, the car was a mistake.
I was driving next to a store window,
and I stop and look in my reflection.
I looked like an asshole.
Yes, I'm sure it was just the car.
A little piece of advice regarding American culture,
a Corvette takes a certain sort of man to be able to pull off.
Like a fedora.
Anyway, keys?
Oh, and now that I'm out of the company,
you'll need to tell Monica what transpired.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, I'm off to be out and about in the 'Vette.
Be back for supper, that is, of course,
unless I get fucked to death by the fairer sex.
Gilfoyle, Richard would like a moment,
if you don't mind.
Do you guys need me to go somewhere else?
No, it's fine. You can stay. You can hear this.
Okay, well, Gilfoyle, I have reviewed the candidates,
and it is very clear to me that our company cannot succeed
without your unrivaled talents as a systems architect.
So, would you please, please, please...
please come work for Pied Piper?
Thanks for asking.
I'm going to put this as delicately as I know how.
You can chortle my balls.
Okay, well...
so who do we want to run front-end dev?
"Cunt-ass" or... "fuck-jerk"?
Listen.
This thing with Gavin isn't gonna work without me,
so, because I feel bad for you
and I'd hate to see you fuck up good tech,
which will happen if I'm not there,
I'm willing to help you.
That's a beautiful gesture.
So, you're back aboard.
FYI, Becca Thorton is
a cancerous prolapsed anus of a human being,
but as a systems engineer, she's not all bad.
Laurie?
Yes. Monica, come in.
I just heard the good news.
About?
Jian-Yang's nimble pivot.
Back away from the glass, please.
Special occasion.
He told me the whole story.
His interview at Periscope,
his discovery of a photo of Bachmann's genitals on his phone
when demonstrating the app,
and his eureka moment when it turned out
that his "not hot dog" technology
out-performed Periscope's own technology.
He said all that?
Not quickly.
The eventual point, jian-Yang unwittingly crafted
an amazing tool for the real-time detection
and filtering of penile imagery.
And Periscope does have a dick problem.
Monica.
Jian-Yang went to Periscope for a job
and walked out with a $4-million acquisition offer.
Given our liquidation preference,
we have 10 X'ed in two weeks, so hats off...
Well, thank you so much.
...to Ed Chen for his shrewd call,
both to invest in this and make you lead.
He is quite astute,
which is why we have promoted him to senior partner.
Monica, you've got Erlich.
I'm here with Jian-Yang,
and he just told me that
you traded ten percent of the company for a used car and a...
A hut.
A hut?
A palapa, and so what?
What do you mean it's a half-a-million-dollar palapa?
Erlich, is the refrigerator running?
This is Mike Hunt, and he's rich.
Shit!
When you begged Richard for the job,
did you actually, like, literally lick his boots,
or did you just go like, "Pretty please, Richard.
Please can I have a job, Richard?"
Whatever I did, it was worth it
for the chance to work without you.
Speaking of, did your deal with Periscope ever close?
Yep. If I stay a year, I vest a big chunk of Twitter stock.
Great. Great.
And... what exactly are you working on?
You know, we're tuning... our algorithm.
We're reconfiguring our... classifier from food to...
another purpose.
In other words, you sit around
and look at dick pics all day long.
Don't let me stop you.
I would say, "Not safe for work,"
but this is your work...
for a year...
at least.
Is that one...
actually a hot dog?
No.
Not hot dog.
{\an4}{\pos(282,232)}Prison Break
This is fucking stupid.
Oh, here's one more for you.
Jian Yang unwittingly crafted an amazing tool
for the real-time detection of penile imagery.
I would say "not safe for work,"
But this is your work...
for a year... at least.
Her name is Mia, and she is a-Mia-zing.
I did sex on her.
Mia is a legit hacker.
What do you think she'll do if you try to break up with her?
A venture like this will render every server obsolete.
- Holy shit. - You know what?
Actually, I'm going to... Welcome to the future, Kevin.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Son of a bitch!
This is where it all began, gentlemen.
The birthplace of Hooli.
Peter Gregory's mother's garage.
That was Peter's workstation.
This was mine.
Things sure have changed.
But in a way, they've stayed exactly the same.
As we forge our new path together,
we must remain focused on what's really important--
not material success or wealth,
but this, the spirit of innovation--
a few coders, some ramen, and a dream.
And that is why I brought you here.
All right. Let me show you the rest of the place.
You've got a garage inside your garage.
Impressive.
I'll move you in as soon as construction is complete.
It's going to be exquisite.
Frank Gehry has really outdone himself.
Yeah. Frank is the fucking best.
He does all my buildings.
Okay, guys. We're all set up.
Shall we?
Yes! Let's do it, of course.
All right. So, in building this peer-to-peer Internet,
the paradox that we're up against is
that people won't want to participate until the quality is high,
and the quality won't be high until, um...
and the quality won't be high
until we have a lot of people opt in to the network,
so that presents a little bit of a-a-- a unique...
Continue.
Okay.
It presents a bit of a problem what with
that we kind of need to build--
Richard, everything okay?
I don't know. Is it?
Sorry. Guys, Bryce. Bryce, guys.
Actually, we've met.
Hey, Donald.
It's Jared now.
So, Gavin. Bryce is...?
Very discreet.
Keep going. This is great.
Is Bryce your assistant?
No, of course not. He's my transfusion associate.
Which is?
Are you really not familiar with parabiosis?
Can't say that I am.
Well, the science is actually pretty fascinating.
Regular transfusions of the blood
of a younger, physically fit donor
can significantly retard the aging process.
And Bryce is a picture of health.
Just look at him. He looks like a Nazi propaganda poster.
This is quite the baby shower.
I bet you think you're some big swinging dick,
now that you're getting invited to all these fancy VC soirees.
Yes. My dick is very enormous...
and my app made Raviga a lot of money.
And I still pay no rent.
Nobody likes a braggart, Jian-Yang.
Hey, guys.
Hello. Congratulations. You're pregnant.
No, no, no. No, she-- No, she-- No, no.
FYI, Monica,
my invite must have gotten lost in the e-mail,
but young Jinathin was kind enough
to add me as his plus-one.
Don't look at me. This is all Ed Chen's doing.
Is that Aarush Agrawal?
I thought he retired.
He's still on the board.
What would a cofounder of Raviga be doing...
at a baby shower?
- How often is he even in the building? - Like once a year.
Ed Chen threw this whole thing just to suck up to Laurie.
Monica...
this is not a baby shower.
This is a coup.
What are you talking about?
Ed Chen didn't throw this party to impress Laurie.
He threw it to oust her.
Invite all these misogynistic A-holes
who think that pregnancy is a weakness,
convince them that she's shirking
her responsibilities at Raviga.
You said it yourself,
there's more dick in here
than a synthetic pussy convention.
I didn't say anything close to that.
- No? - No.
Regardless, Ed Chen and Aarush are bro'ing down.
I suggest you get in before you get cut out.
You see this guy?
Tequila shots at a baby shower.
You want me to join the frat house?
Unfortunately, in this climate, Monica,
- you either bro down or you go down. - Monica.
Laurie is also pregnant.
Jian-Yang, are you drinking creamer?
It's half-half.
Which brings us to our one final, crucial question.
What value can we offer now to the user
to entice them to download the app and opt in to our network?
And the answer is...
the brand-new Pied Piper app.
The app will take all of the data on a person's phone
and compress it,
freeing up 20 percent more storage.
They can have half of that free memory,
while we will take the other half,
walled off on their phone, for our own future use.
It's a win-win.
That's very well thought out.
Well done, gentlemen.
So, when do we announce?
Announce what?
Richard, when I do something, it's news.
Don't you think you want to lean into that?
We'll announce, rack up huge user interest,
and then do a massive public launch at scale.
No. We planned this under the assumption
that it would be rolling out quietly
and not really talking about our ultimate intentions.
Besides, rolling out at scale is a completely different model
with vastly different technical and business challenges.
And we're not prepared for that.
No. I think we'd all agree
that a-- a stealth rollout would be best for this one.
Bryce?
Did you have a thought?
you know, it just seems like a missed opportunity.
I mean, shouldn't you figure out
how a big launch would work
before you just say no to it?
Or-- Or not.
You know, it's not my company.
That is so true.
You know, Richard, Bryce makes a good point.
Why don't you guys just whip up an alternate launch plan
with a big public rollout,
and then we can compare apples to apples.
Gavin, all-all-- all due respect.
This plan took two weeks to develop.
Hard work is the price of greatness,
so let's get to work.
Well, this meeting was just absolutely fucking great!
Richard, Donald... Gilfoyle!
Go team!
The fuck just happened?
- Hey, Bryce? - Yeah?
Next time you're at a meeting of our company,
of which you are not a part of in any respect,
can you please keep your little ideas to yourself?
I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm just-- I'm just trying to be helpful.
Well, you weren't, at all.
I mean, we had him on our side,
because I'd basically just convinced Gavin
that a stealth rollout was the best idea.
You know, well, I--
It's just a stealth rollout
doesn't sound like the way to go to me.
What-What-- What are you talking about?
I mean, Gavin has obviously
had a lot more success than you, Richard,
and I just think having an asset like Gavin Belson
- on your side-- - - What'd you say?
You dick!
You dick! You dick!
- Okay. - All right.
- Fuck you! - Okay. It's okay.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay.
This is already the best job I ever had.
I don't know what to say. I am so, so sorry.
I just couldn't let Bryce talk to you like that.
- Did I frighten you? - No.
Fuck him, right?
And fuck Gavin.
I mean, what, we take his orders now? He's our boss?
We're supposed to be partners, you know, like equals. Right?
And what? He's taking the advice
of that stupid, little pretty boy over me?
Wait. He has a garage in his garage?
And he has a yacht with a pool on it
and a pool with a yacht in it.
And he has a real, live blood boy.
What? He has an actual blood boy?
That's real?
Yeah, he's real. Real mouthy.
I mean, he's sticking his perfectly symmetrical face
into actual smart people's business.
I mean, that Ken doll
probably thinks traversing a binary search tree
runs in the order of "N", Instead of "Log N". Idiot.
Jared called him a dick.
Seriously? To his face? No.
- Yeah. - That sounds awesome.
But it's probably nothing compared to
the thousands upon thousands of gnarled male genitals
that you get to see every day at your job.
Fuck.
- Brought you some dinner, 'Neshi. - Thank you.
"'Neshi"?
Shut the fuck up, Gilfoyle.
You just missed these idiots
telling me how hard they're selling out
by working for fucking Gavin Belson
in his disgusting lap of luxury.
Seriously, how can you work for that asshole?
My man, the Gavin Killer,
would never compromise his principles for money.
Oh, no?
No, he would not.
And he is busy doing the rewarding work
of keeping the Internet free of graphic sexual imagery.
Can we eat later?
Of course.
I'm gonna go put this in the fridge.
Okay. Yeah. Thank you.
You actually still haven't told her
that your takedown of Gavin Belson...
...was an accident?
It hasn't come up.
We were just talking about him...
...with her, so it did come up.
- Gavin. Hello. - Hey, could you--
Richard, did you and a member of your team verbally assault
my transfusion associate?
Do you have any idea what that kind of stress
could do to his cortisol levels?
And therefore, my cortisol levels?
Y-- Yeah. Well, uh, he's not technically in the company,
and he kind of just butted in, so--
Is your ego so fragile
that if someone disagrees with you,
you have to demean them?
I want you to go and apologize to Bryce immediately.
Why should I apologize?
Why should I be in business
with someone who treats support staff with such contempt?
You can tell a lot about a person's character
by how they treat the little people, Richard.
I bet you're mean to waiters, too.
What? No. I'm-- I'm awesome to waiters.
Well, then I suggest you be awesome to Bryce, too.
His blood is flowing through my veins, Richard.
Make this right.
Fucking blood boy.
What do you want, Richard?
Bryce, I wanted to swing by
and apologize for yelling at you
when you offered your very unsolicited opinion.
Also, on behalf of Jared,
we mean no disrespect to you or your career choice. Okay?
My career choice?
You think that I moved out here to be a blood boy?
- Did you know I have a degree in CS? - You do?
Yeah, but you probably thought
that I was just, you know, some dumb jock.
Well, that's typical, because people who look like me,
we never get taken seriously in the tech business
by people who look like you.
You're biased.
Hang on. I am not biased. Okay?
Come on! The whole business is biased!
I mean, that's the only way that a good-looking guy like me
could get in a room with Gavin Belson,
is by being a blood boy!
And that sucks. I-- I got to work out constantly.
I can't have a beer with my friends. I can't eat junk food.
Do you know that Gavin made me go full veg?
I mean, fuck soy, man!
But to people like you, I'm just a beautiful bag of blood.
But you know what? I got some pretty good fucking ideas,
and Gavin actually listens to those ideas.
It took a while, but he respects me.
And you know what, Richard Hendricks?
You clearly fucking don't.
So good night.
Look, it's Osama Bin Fuckin'.
Thought you were staying at Mia's tonight.
I was going to, but, alas, I had some intestinal distress,
so I couldn't stay, which really sucks
because she's so great,
which really is horrible,
because it's so hard to be away from her,
because she's so great. Can I contin...
I have no diarrhea. I lied.
I am so fucked.
This girl is gonna kill me or get me killed.
Do tell.
So, she's super attractive,
and she's super smart, and she's way into me,
like way more than a normal person should be.
And sex! There's so much sex!
The problem is the part after.
When you have to apologize.
No. When we do pillow talk.
That's the best part.
Everything before that is just foreplay.
Not with her. She'll tell me how cute I am,
and how into me she is,
and how she hacked into Bowman Avenue dam.
That was the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.
No. It was her. She pinned it on them.
She flooded an area being surveyed for hotel construction.
Just to confirm, honesty is off the table, right?
Because it seems like the longer you wait,
the-- the worse it's gonna get.
I'm with Jared. You should wait.
I have to end it, right now.
First thing Monday.
Well, Saturday is her sister's wedding.
And then Sunday-- you know,
Sundays are just for me, you guys know that.
Wait. Her sister's wedding?
- That's what you should be afraid of. - Why?
That's a threshold that you don't want to cross.
Well, I mean, weddings are very public events
with photographers taking pictures of you
indelibly tied to her.
Those are forever photos.
Forever.
Fuck.
Hey, guys. I'm trying to find Erlich.
Is he... "holding"?
I'm afraid you caught me at an inopportune time.
I'm long overdue to a trip to my dispensary,
so I don't have much.
But I have Bubba Kush,
Chocolate Thunder, Barbara Bush,
Barbara Streisand, Barbara Bush Jr.--
Yeah, this-- this is plenty.
No, no. That-- That's actually for my astigmatism.
Okay.
This is in case of emergency only.
I'll need it if an earthquake occurs.
Okay. Just give me whatever. I don't care.
It's not for me. It's for Ed Chen.
What are you up to, clever girl?
Well, I took your advice.
It wasn't pretty,
but, uh, I bro'ed down with him pretty hard.
I mean, I think I did. It's--
To be honest, I was kind of all over the map.
I shotgunned a warm beer,
and then I acted all blown away
when he showed me 40 minutes of snowboarding videos
set to Diplo remixes.
Good on you.
But it worked.
I'm in. Ed copped to everything,
and said that as long as I don't say anything to Laurie,
I have a seat at the table.
Wait. Did he say that? Those were his exact words?
You'll have a seat if you don't tell Laurie?
Yeah. So?
Oh, dear. That does not bode well for you.
What do you mean?
Well, if Ed Chen is afraid of you saying anything to Laurie,
then that means that the deal isn't solidified yet.
He doesn't have the votes.
Unfortunately for you, that would mean
you may have put your money on the wrong horse.
So you mean Laurie still has a chance to survive this coup?
Well, then why did you say I should bro down with Ed Chen?
I say a lot of things, Monica.
I say a lot of things.
I know you think I'm some sort of crusading badass
who built a ticking time bomb
and slipped it to Gavin Belson
to bring him down
as retribution for his wrongdoings.
But the truth is,
because of my gross incompetence
during my brief and utterly disgraceful tenure
as PiperChat CEO,
I incurred billions of dollars in COPPA fines
by exploiting underage users,
and was saved only by my own cowardice,
which led to me throwing up on myself.
Anyway, I'll show myself out.
I'm so proud of you.
It took guts for you to tell me this.
Oh, no, no, no, it didn't actually.
Full disclosure: I knew all about this.
I hacked into your phone
the first night we were together
when you were in the bathroom.
I was in there a while.
I was hoping that once I earned your trust,
you'd feel comfortable telling me.
- And you finally did! - I did.
This may sound crazy,
but if you hadn't by this weekend,
I was actually considering
disinviting you from my sister's wedding.
No way.
But you trusted me with your big secret.
So I'll trust you with another of mine.
Oh, no, you don't have to. You don't.
I hacked the elevators at the Freedom Tower.
No.
Fucking kill me and send me to the horrors of heaven.
It'd be better than this shit.
Guys, I know this has been a ton of work,
and we wouldn't have to do it if pretty boy kept his mouth shut,
and the stealth launch is still clearly the play,
but now we can show Gavin
that we fleshed out both options.
And we can still push the space-saving app...
and not talk about our new Internet until we're ready.
- Ahoy, gents. - Geary Street.
What, you're eating health food now?
Can you imagine?
Geary Street Organics is not a health food store?
Richard, you are a stitch.
No, it's my dispensary.
I mean, they have some edibles there.
- They're not very healthy. - Fucking blood boy.
Yeah. I was walking around your 'hood,
and I thought I'd swing by, and we could talk about tech,
you know, 'cause we both know so much about it.
- Cool. - Oh, man.
I-I-- I don't know if you know this,
but you-- your eyes are super red right now.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I have allergies.
Really? This time of year?
Look, w-- what are doing?
Oh, just-- just hanging, man. Why? You paranoid?
Paranoid? No.
You know, Bryce, I got to be honest,
I'm a little hungry. Do you have anything to eat?
Just some creatine, protein powder, soy extract.
Well, I'm kind of looking for something a little bit more sweet.
Oh, Bryce!
Yeah. That-- That's not mine.
That's for my guests. My-- My fat guests.
You know, the fella who owns the house I live in,
he buys food like this,
because when he uses the products he buys
at the very same health food store you go to,
he gets cravings...
for food just like this.
And this stuff is not good for your blood.
Geary Street Organics isn't a food store, is it?
It's a pot dispensary. Isn't it?
I got you, Bryce! You fuckin' liar!
You said you had a degree in CS.
Well, bullshit. I checked.
It's not Computer Science.
It's "Calisthenic Studies."
What? What?
You listen to me, you muscle-bound, handsome Adonis.
Tech is reserved for people like me. Okay?
The freaks, the weirdos, the misfits,
the geeks, the dweebs, the dorks!
Not you.
Oh, and your days of leeching off Gavin Belson are over.
Game over, blood boy.
You fuckin' nerd.
Laurie?
Look. I know you've been unhappy with me lately.
- Correct. - Look. I'm asking you to trust me on something.
Ed Chen has been making moves behind your back
with the other partners to try and force you out of Raviga.
You are referring to the baby shower ruse.
You knew about that?
Monica, this is my fourth child.
I am no stranger to these types of machinations.
However, I have countervailed it with my--
Your fourth child?
Yes.
As I was saying...
I have spoken to our top LPs
and lined up enough of them
in order to leave Raviga and start a new firm.
It struck me as a opportune time to jump ship.
Holy shit! You're a fuckin' ninja.
No.
Even though your disclosure just now
had absolutely no actionable value,
it did reveal tremendous loyalty,
so... all is well now.
So, you're not mad at me anymore?
No, Monica.
I am a human being, just like you,
like Ed Chen...
and this.
Furthermore...
a question, Monica.
Would you care to jump ship with me?
You are, after all, my best friend.
What?
Fuck.
- What are you guys doing? - Hands behind your back, now!
Get your hands off me!
- I got it. - Ma'am, calm down.
- You can't do this! - Let her go!
I want my lawyer!
- And just take the cuffs off. - What is the meaning of this?
- Dinesh, they're arresting me! - What?
Step back, sir.
Good people of the FBI,
I don't know what sorts of things you were told
or who told them to you-- we may never know--
but I can assure you that this young woman is...
Gavin. I'm sorry to drop in on you,
but I happened to have a very enlightening conversation
with your "Transfusion associate."
So did I.
S-- S-- Sorry?
Come in, Richard.
It's all broken... again.
Mind the glass.
Okay.
He's writing a tell-all?
Apparently, he landed a very lucrative deal
to air my dirty laundry over the years.
He said it was his only career move left.
I told you, Richard, everything I do is news.
But didn't he sign an NDA with you? I mean, can't you sue him?
That would only prove everything
he's saying is true and make it worse.
Speaking of, I had my blood tested this morning.
My cholesterol is through the roof.
At this rate, I'll be dead by the age of 120.
Oh, no. That-- I'm so sorry.
No. Richard, I'm sorry.
I told you that a big public rollout of
our product would be good for the company.
The truth is, I thought it would be good for me...
to change the narrative that I'm a fraud and a failure.
Come on, Bryce is the fraud.
And yet, I sat here taking business advice from him.
A fucking blood boy.
Just look at me.
I'm a fraud, and everyone knows it.
And when I fell, not one person stood up for me.
What does that say?
I just think it's all over for me now.
No, it's-- it's not over. Look...
I chose to partner with you. That-- that says something.
You didn't want me.
You wanted the patent. If I had just given it to you,
you would've walked out that door and never looked back.
Fuck it!
I'm done.
Done? No.
No, Gavin, you're not-- you're not done.
I mean, what about our company?
What about the new Internet?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Gavin...
Fuck you, God!
What have I done to deserve this?
Yes. CJ Cantwell, please.
Something you want to share with us, Richard?
I take it you saw the interview?
"Belson and Hendricks prepare to launch
a Pied Piper product soon."
So much for a stealth rollout.
You went along with him after all.
TechCrunch and Recode,
and The Wall Street Journal picked it up as well.
I hate to invoke the Nazarene,
but, Jesus Christ, what the fuck, Richard?
Guys, in a world where...
there is no Gavin Belson,
yeah, the stealth rollout was the best play.
But we need his patent, and his funding,
and, also, we need his brain.
I know this is going to be a shit-ton of work, but...
Gavin is our partner. We need him engaged.
I made the call.
Well, sometimes you have to make compromises.
I mean, I once slept with the head of an assisted-living facility
to get my friend Muriel bumped up the wait list.
Am I proud of it? No.
Do I regret it?
I'm out!
Oh my God.
- Out of what exactly? - My relationship!
The wedding got raided.
The FBI got an anonymous tip about Mia's hacking exploits.
Can you believe that? Just my luck!
I'm home free!
You ratted your girlfriend out to the FBI,
because you're too big of a pussy to break up with her?
I'll never tell, but yes, yes, I did.
The FBI lady hit me in the face,
so Mia's never going to suspect me.
Richard, now that Mia and I have parted ways,
can I come work for you at Gavin's? Please, please, please.
Well, uh, yes, Dinesh, of course.
In fact, we just announced, so climb aboard.
Awesome! I'm going to go call Periscope, tell them I quit.
Best day ever. No more dick pics!
Hello, Gavin.
Richard, I read your little article.
What you said means a great deal.
I'm sure if the situation was reversed, you'd do the same for me.
Absolutely not. I would've let you bleed to death in the street.
And that gives me pause.
I have a lot of work to do, Richard.
We all do, so get back on the saddle, you.
No, Richard.
I have a lot work I need to do on myself.
I'm going away.
For, like, the weekend or...?
No, Richard. Many weekends.
Weekdays as well.
Where--
Uh, hang on. There's someone at the door.
I know. I sent you something.
Consider it a little parting gift.
Good luck to you, Richard.
It's from Gavin.
What is it?
It's the patent.
He just signed over full ownership to me.
On the phone, he said he was going to go find himself.
I think... Gavin's gone.
Well, what about his funding? And his brain?
I think he took both of those with him.
We got one more thing.
All right! What has two thumbs,
zero dick pics, and just quit Periscope?
What the fuck is that?
The biggest dick pic of all.
You know what? Should we--
Fuck yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I guess just put it in the garage.
Oh. Uh, where I sleep?
Yeah, it's just, it's the only place with room.
Okay. Uh, well, it's good to face your fears.
I was scared of intruders till I had one of those in my room,
and then I realized, you know,
if they're gonna kill me, they're gonna kill me.
'Cause he kept... whispering that.
All right.
- Hey, Russ. - "Hey, Russ"?
Fuck you, Richard Hendricks!
Fuck me regarding?
It's all over the blogs. You took our idea to Gavin Belson?
I'm sorry. Our idea?
Yeah, the new Internet. We came up with that together,
standing outside of my kid's school-- former school.
Uh, no, um, you told me to name an idea,
and so I named one. That was my idea,
you were just standing there.
Yeah, pulling it out of you like a newborn baby.
Okay, but, well, if a doctor
pulls a baby out of a pregnant woman,
the doctor doesn't get to then keep the baby.
Okay, first of all, my ex-wife is fucking the doctor
that delivered my son, and they're suing for full custody,
so you're wrong. Second of all, this isn't a baby.
Stop trying to change the subject, Richard!
Okay, well, uh, I had to go to Gavin,
because he owned the patent
which, as it turns out, he just signed over to me.
So, um, it's actually good that you're here,
because... you want in and we need funding,
especially since no VC in town will touch us,
not even Monica's new firm.
So, Gavin pulls out, and you want me to be your sloppy seconds.
It's always about my money, isn't it?
Uh, well, you are an investor, so what else would it be about?
- My idea! - It was my idea!
Well, then fund it yourself.
Fuck you, Richard Hendricks.
Fuck you right in your little asshole,
and not in the beautiful way, like Grandpa and Pedro.
Uh, what the hell was that?
That was the last wealthy guy in Silicon Valley
that would even fucking talk to us.
Maybe I'll give him a day to cool off,
try him again tomorrow or something.
Not so sure about that.
- Oh, come on. - Payback's a bitch, isn't it, Richard?
I don't think he knows that's not your car.
Real estate listings? What, are you looking to move out?
No, I'm just taking a little Redfin holiday.
I find there's a certain escapist allure to real estate listings.
I like that one.
Too bad it's 10 times what I can afford,
'cause, you know, I quit Periscope to go work
for a company with zero prospects, 'cause fuck me.
Well, with preconstruction pricing,
this one's actually only six times more than you could afford.
So now, let's go into Amazon
and see what we could buy...
...with all those imaginary savings.
Wait a minute.
What if we don't need an investor at all?
Fuck all these VCs.
What if all we need is a customer?
Customer for what? We haven't built the product yet.
Well, uh, neither have all those condo builders, right?
I mean, they are offering a discount to people
who buy before they build.
We can do the same thing, but with data storage.
- That sounds like a scam. - Well, no, it's actually common practice.
It's how I bought my condo. The scam came after
when I rented to a squatter who wouldn't leave.
Granted, there's no shortage of huge corporations
with vast amounts of data, but it's highly risky.
I mean, Richard, we'd be offering to store data
on a network of cellphones
before we built the app or the network.
Yeah, but look, look, it's no more risky
than working with all these crazy billionaires.
I mean, Jack and his boxes.
Gavin just fucked off to go find himself who knows where.
Peter died.
Yeah, I guess that makes him crazy.
The point is, if you don't draw the line in the sand
when some guy pisses in your car, where do you, you know?
Did someone piss in someone's car?
Not literally, no. It's a, uh,
It's a figure of speech, an old one.
An adage.
Anyway, uh, Jared, let's get a deck together on this.
Aye, aye, Captain. And, uh, just word to the wise,
often the first customer is the hardest one to land.
Wait. Customer? Are we pitching?
- Yeah, looks like it. - Hot damn, Richie!
Let's hit the road. We're gonna piss in everyone's car.
Am I using that right?
Medical groups, sales groups, insurance companies,
Jared, yeah, good work here, really.
Well, Gavin was right.
His name certainly opened a lot of doors.
Ever since your announcement, everyone has heard of us.
Jared, you didn't tell all these people
that Gavin was still working with the company, did you?
Well, no, but I-- I never explicitly said that he wasn't.
- Was that wrong? - No, Jared, that's fine.
The tech will speak for itself.
It certainly will.
Now, Richard, when we get into that room,
let me do all the talking.
And also the tech will talk.
Wait. So Gavin's not coming?
No, but we are.
We've already come.
Gavin left the company?
Yes, um, but what's important-- at least we think--
is not whether Gavin is gone,
but what brought him to us in the first place,
and that's the tech.
Gentlemen, sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm George Mandechian, CEO.
I'm very excited to...
He did? When?
Okay.
God damn it.
I mean, if people would just look at what we're offering,
I think they'd be blown away.
Perhaps we need a new angle.
- I'll fake a seizure. - What?
Pied Piper? Hi. I'm Liz Tinsdale,
head of compliance here at Fiduciated General.
Erlich Bachman.
And I'm, uh, Richard Hendricks.
- Are we all here? - Yes, yeah, we are.
Uh, sorry, full disclosure:
uh, Gavin Belson has left the company.
- I see. Well... - His loss.
He won't be...
sitting across from someone
as charming as yourself this afternoon, will he?
Okay. Well, I mean, you did come all the way here,
so why don't you follow me?
I'd follow you to the end of the Earth. Shall we?
- What are you doing, hmm? - What?
So, as you can see, your data will be even more secure,
because it will be stored on multiple devices.
And we can offer you a very competitive rate.
You can expect to see storage savings annually of...
25 percent.
That's very impressive, all of it,
but you guys have to understand that companies like ours
are particularly risk averse.
Is it a slight Idaho accent, Liz?
Oh. It's Montana, actually.
Even better. The big blue sky state. Yeah.
Well, I knew you had to have come from above.
Well, uh, speaking of heaven,
that's probably where you'll think you are
when you start saving 25 percent on your data storage.
Get an upgrade from there.
Liz, you have beautiful skin.
- Um, thank-- thank you. - You, uh-- yeah.
Both of you.
Listen, uh, I think I know what he's gonna say,
but let me see if I can pull my CTO in here.
Can you... reel it in a little?
We're trying to make a business deal, not get you laid.
I'm not trying to get laid, Richard.
Clearly, she has a lot of pent-up sexual energy,
likely from working in this worm farm,
so that's the angle I'm taking
since I'm not allowed to have a seizure.
Besides, she's going to bat for us.
You should be thanking me. The CTO is on the way in.
Yes, because of the technology
and because of our business proposal.
Look, can you just please, for once,
keep your dick out of the equation?
I really wish I could, but my dick is the abacus
- upon which this equation will be-- - Guys.
This is our CTO.
Great.
Hello.
I'm Dan Melcher. Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Hello.
Hi, Dan.
- Do-- Do you guys know each other? - No.
I just said my name was Dan, that's how he knows.
I don't need to waste any more of your time with this.
Why don't I-I-- I'll take this one from here.
- Okay? Oh. - Yeah.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Very rude, Daniel.
Although, what can we expect after TechCrunch Disrupt
when you sucker punched me in the god damn face?
You fucked my wife.
I fucked your wives. Plural.
Both of them.
Erlich, the customer is always right,
so let's just leave it at "Wife," Singular, and be done with it.
Okay.
I need you to listen to me very carefully.
It took me a very long, long time
to get back on my feet after I got fired from Oracle,
and... tech firms wouldn't touch me,
but I've managed to find a home here, a life.
Okay, it's insurance. It's not ideal,
but, you know, it-- it's something.
And I don't care whatever it is that you're selling here.
I'm not buying it.
Well, it's a pretty groundbreaking technology.
Oh, shut the fuck up.
- Okay, yeah, d-- uh-- - Look at me.
Never gonna happen. Okay?
- Never going to-- - Dan?
Did you give the dogs their medicine this morning?
Uh, no, was I supposed to?
Yeah, because, remember, I had to go back
to the restaurant to get your card that you forgot.
Uh, yep. Sorry.
Um, I s-- I mean, I guess I could run home.
- You two married? - Oh, not yet. We're engaged.
- Well, it was nice to meet you both. - Bye now, Liz.
- All right, bye, honey. - Bye.
Oh, Dan.
Dan, Dan, Dan.
Dan Melcher? The guy who beat the piss out of you?
The very same.
I looked him dead in the eyes, and I said,
"Daniel, I've fucked every wife you've ever had.
Care to go three for three?"
Needless to say, he did not.
You don't come off in that story as well as you think you do.
So, to avoid being thrice made a cuckold,
he agreed to a deal?
Well, uh, not yet. Melcher actually signed off on it,
but his fiancée wanted to certify
that what we're trying to build complies
with their data-handling and security protocols.
We're reviewing it all tomorrow, actually.
Ah, I can't wait.
Tomorrow the real fun begins.
- Uh, no. No. You're not coming. - Why not?
Why not? Uh... jeez.
Well, you fucked Dan's last wife
the night before he was our judge on the TechCrunch panel,
with absolutely no regard for what that meant to the company.
What it meant to the company
was that we went to the finals, and we won.
Because of the tech.
We won because of the tech, remember?
We're getting this deal because of the tech.
I'm not letting you fuck this up, okay?
I know you're looking for something to do,
but this is not it.
What do you mean, I'm looking for something to do?
You're lucky that you've garnished this much of my time.
I have plenty to do! Tons of lots of things!
I have a thriving incubator.
It is thriving.
Isn't it?
Fuck you, guys.
Okay, so, how soon can we test our app on a phone?
Look, uh, about all this Erlich stuff--
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I-I-- I don't wanna talk about him...
or think about him... ever again.
Okay, look, I've-- I've signed off.
But, Richard, I need you
to look me in the eye and tell me that this is gonna work,
'cause if it doesn't, I'm completely fucked.
It's-- It's gonna work. I promise.
All right, well, look, I'm gonna step out. Okay.
- You're in good hands. Okay. - Okay.
- Should we start with adjuster records? - Sure.
You guys said you were proficient in video files, right?
We were a-- a video chat company for a while.
- Oh, that's exciting. - Uh, yeah, I guess.
It-- It wasn't really for me.
Um, in fact, actually, just as we were taking off, I walked away.
- Commitment issues? - Uh, I don't know.
It's just I... I never really...
thought that video chat
was the best use of our compression.
Kind of felt like I was settling, you know?
Ooh! Settling.
- Yeah, our company can grow in ways... - Oh, fuck.
...that we haven't even thought of yet.
I mean, I was going to spend the rest of my life
just wondering if there was something better.
That's not really a way to live.
And, what, I'm gonna say to all my friends, like,
"Oh, this is how I'm spending my time," You know?
Every morning I-- I get up, and it's vidchat.
Then I go to bed, and it's vidchat.
Then I get up again, it's vidchat.
I wanna kill myself, you know?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think I know what you mean.
Yeah.
So, what do you think, Erlich?
You're the first person to see the place.
I love the smell of fresh spackle and hope.
Yep. Two more weeks and Bream-Hall's in business.
Even better that donkey Ed Chen
and Raviga were so blindsided,
they're running around with their hair on fire.
Yeah, it's a beautiful world, Erlich.
And after years of busting my ass, I'm finally doing it.
And check it out, we even have swag...
with my name on it.
- Look, "Monica Hall." - Laurie!
Hello. Well, good. Now that you're both here,
we can dispense with the mindless chitchat.
I'd like to be the first to offer you, both,
the opportunity to take me off the market.
I don't understand.
I'm saying that I very much respect
what you're doing here, almost revere it,
and I wanted to offer my services as an associate.
And I will not phone it in.
I'll be the first one here at 10:30 a.M.
and the last one to leave a smidge after 4:00.
I'll, of course, need an office,
an attractive personal assistant,
paternity leave, if that goes well,
and an umbrella insurance policy if that does not go well.
What do you say?
I'd like a job, dears.
The singular function of this firm
is to insure that our investors' money is in wise hands.
If... you are known for anything,
it is quite the opposite.
Therefore, no.
I'm sorry, Erlich.
Look, I-- I know you're looking for something to do, but--
Who-- Who is pushing this false narrative
that I am looking for something to do?
- "But"... what? - But Laurie is my partner,
and if she doesn't think you add any real value,
then there's no future for you here.
I gave you weed, a lot of it.
You want a fleece?
God, there's something beautiful
about testing your first alpha.
It's like watching a child take its first steps.
Well, let's see if our space-saver app
actually saves us any space.
All right. Done.
Yeah?
Can I mark this deliverable as complete?
Is our child a dancer?
Wait. I was only using 32.2 gigs of data before the test,
and now it says I'm using 47.8.
Fuck. Mine expanded also. What the fuck?
Why do I have a photo folder entitled "Cool Hairstyles"?
Why do I have an e-mail for the "Anton LaVey Fun Run"?
Fuck. We had a merge error.
All of our information is on both phones.
I wonder what kind of weird shit you get into.
What are you doing?
I'm just looking at your very embarrassing personal information.
Fuck you. If you look at my shit, I'm gonna look at your shit.
All right, whoa, whoa. Easy now.
I'll go balls deep on your inbox.
If you've taken one fucking selfie, I will find it.
Okay, guys, we've got to calm down.
Okay? Look at this. This is not where we wanna be.
Let's-- Let's take a deep breath,
and let's just be cool and put our phones down.
Go ahead.
I'll put it down once he stops touching it.
Okay. Great.
Good. That wasn't so hard, was it?
- If he can do it - No. No, no, no, no, no.
- It's okay. - Gotcha.
No, you didn't. Fuck you.
Are those almond poppy seed muffins or lemon poppy seed muffins?
No matter, I'll take both,
and the, uh, whole first floor.
It's been a...
pretty bad...
You know what?
Do you have any day-olds?
Hey, are you sitting here?
What the fuck does it look like?
Sorry. He didn't tell us
who he was inviting to the meeting.
He just said it was a bunch of us. How many are we?
I think a few other firms are coming.
Sequoia and Greylock, maybe a few more for this round.
Jeff from Index Ventures.
You brought swag to a pitch meeting?
Yikes, that's so three years ago.
Have you seen Keenan yet?
I don't know who that is.
Seriously, though, I don't know who you're talking about.
Bream-Hall?
Hey, man. I don't know who you think you are,
but you're not supposed to be at this table.
I don't know who you think you are,
but men aren't supposed to grow tits,
and yet there they are, atop your little paunch.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm fucking Erlich Bachman.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Keenan Feldspar.
And I like the balls on you.
Get outta there! I wanna sit next to this guy!
Yeah.
Oh, man! Nice swag!
I tell you, it is, um, it is warm in here.
Yeah, they, um, shut the AC off after midnight.
The things this company goes through to save a dime.
Well, classic Melcher.
Okay, should we cover this section
on intrusion detection and prevention?
Liz?
Okay, I don't want to pry,
but did I do something wrong?
It's just for the past few hours, you've been a little, um...
- checked out. - Uh, I'm just...
- thinking. - So, you're getting cold feet?
- What? - It's okay. I know what you're dealing with.
I don't think you do.
I do. Trust me, I do.
Okay, I bet someone in your position
has been told many times to look before you leap.
But, Liz...
what about right now you just... leap before you look?
And, look, I'm gonna go out on a limb here,
but I'm gonna go ahead and say
that I'll bet there's a piece of you deep down inside
that... knows this is a good idea.
It's new, it's exciting.
I mean, by God, Liz, this is the most durable,
sophisticated decentralized storage infrastructure
the world has-
And then it just happened.
- On the floor? - We were like two wild animals.
I'm sure it was magnificent.
I get pissed at Erlich for not keeping it in his pants,
and then I go ahead and do this?
Shit. I mean, Dan's gonna find out.
I mean, he punched Erlich in the face for when he did it to him,
and now what do you think he's gonna do to me, huh?
He's gonna fucking kill me, then the deal's gonna fall through.
I can't believe I jeopardized the entire company with my dick.
Hey, hey. We can get through this.
- Yeah. All right. - First, I need some details.
- Are you in love? - What?
No, no, I barely know her.
Okay. Okay, that's good.
Then, we just need to extricate you from this situation.
Okay. Now, it's not gonna be easy,
because she's very probably in love with you.
Jared, I-- I don't think that that's--
Richard, this is no time for false humility.
You're a catch. Just deal with it.
Now, you need to break this thing off clean and clear,
so you just walk into that office
- and-- and you look her in the eyes, and you say... - Mm-hmm?
"Listen, baby...
"You're getting hitched, and-- and I...
was born to roam."
"Born to roam"?
Hey, Jared, did I miss any calls?
Not a good time, my man.
Jared.
Sorry.
Nope. No calls.
What a shocker.
I need to call Tara.
Okay, but I-- I need to hold your phone.
It might be sexual in nature.
Well, I think I can handle that.
All right.
No, um, something else in here, please?
- Monica, this salient-- - Mmm?
Ladies.
What are you doing here?
I believe the answer to that question...
is currently sitting in your unfinished waiting area.
Holy shit. Is that...
Keenan Feldspar? Yes.
Why? Have you heard of him?
Of course. Every competent VC has.
His VR headset is reputed to be the new standard.
Oh, it is. I tested the prototype last night at his house.
We got quite drunk.
What exactly is he doing in our waiting area?
Well, Laurie, he's waiting...
upon my instruction.
Imagine...
landing the biggest whale in the Valley...
two weeks
before you launch your firm.
Or should I say before we launch your firm?
All right. The new build is done.
I am so glad this is over.
I felt like Gibraltar in World War II,
where it was both crucial and inert.
All right. One press of the button, and we are back to normal.
What's the problem?
I don't know.
What don't you know?
Well, you seem a bit eager to resolve the situation.
You're almost anxious.
It's a new color on you.
A new color on you would be--
Even as you try and make a boring, racist comment,
you can't keep your eyes off my phone.
See? Now, I know all my embarrassing shit is on your phone
and if you look at it,
you will mock me endlessly and without mercy.
But what's also true is that
you already mock me endlessly and without mercy,
so I have nothing to lose
and, potentially, a huge amount to gain.
Guys, this is madness.
I have nothing to hide.
I hear you, and yet...
I'd like to look at my phone.
Sure.
Suit yourself.
- Swipe. - Mm-hmm.
- Unlock. - Mmm.
You sure you don't care?
Does it look like I care?
Okay.
Fuck!
What the fuck?
You dick!
- Give me the phone. - Dinesh.
- Give it to me. - You are not thinking clearly.
Sorry.
Looks like we both lose.
- I don't think so. - How do you figure?
'Cause now I know you had some embarrassing shit to hide.
I don't even need to know what it is.
My phone may be in the toilet, but...
- but I win. - No, you don't.
Because you'll never know what was on there...
and that will slowly drive you down a dark path
and torment you, so that every fiber--
Nuh-uh! I win! I win!
I win. I win. I win!
I win!
Shut up, Jared.
Last night...
Last night was...
- Bad. - ...bad. Bad.
- Yeah, oh my God. - Yeah. It was bad, right?
It was such a bad thing to have done.
The worst sex I think I've ever had...
by far.
Oh, s-- it-- so it was bad for you... too.
Yeah, I mean, it was just all elbows.
I mean, how many times did our teeth clink?
- Too many. Mm-mm. Too many. - You know?
- Too many. - And you move your head a lot.
- Well... passion-- - None.
- Right? I know. - Definitely.
Like right out of the gate.
When I took my top off,
and you actually said the word "gulp"?
- I said it? - Yes. Yeah.
Out loud? Okay. Well, mistake on my part.
As bad as it was, you know,
- and it was bad, um... - Okay.
like... really... awful.
- I get it. - I just...
If there's an upside to any of this,
it would be that I realize now what I have in Dan.
- Silver lining, so that's nice. - Listen,
I can't do this... anymore.
This-- What we--
So, I just wanna-- If we could just close the deal,
be done with it.
And if it's okay with Dan, it's fine with me.
- So... - Good.
- Okay. - Okay.
So, I will come back and get my stuff when you're gone.
No, I'm just gonna... the door.
I was born to roam, anyways.
Richard.
Liz just told me.
- She did? - Yup.
And... if it's fine with her,
then I guess the deal is fine with me,
so... it's approved.
- Good. - I'll ride down with you.
Oh, you don't have to. Okay.
Listen.
It goes without saying, but...
Liz can never find out
about that whole thing between us.
Okay. Yep.
And walked out with a $4-million acquisition offer.
Erlich, is the refrigerator running?
This is Mike Hunt,
and he's rich.
Shit!
I'd like a job, dears.
And I will not phone it in.
I'll be the first one here at 10:30 a.M.
and the last one to leave a smidge after 4:00.
You ratted your girlfriend out to the FBI,
because you're too big of a pussy
to break up with her?
I'll never tell, but yes, yes, I did.
She wouldn't happen to know the model of our router, would she?
- Ladies. - Holy shit. Is that...
Keenan Feldspar? Yes.
Imagine landing the biggest whale
two weeks before we launch your firm.
That's a good one, Richard.
No, but seriously, what brings you in today?
No, I am-- I am serious. I would like a... an STD check.
What, did you graze your penis against a toilet seat?
No. I... I had sex.
- Sex with what? - Female.
A female what?
A female human.
And I-I don't know this woman very well,
and we didn't use a condom.
Now, listen, Richard, I wouldn't worry so much.
People don't really get STDs anymore.
We'll get your tests back soon, and I would tell you
not to have sex before then, but let's face it--
lightning ain't gonna strike twice, is it?
It's possible.
It's possible.
No.
Hey, here's something strange.
Would you mind hopping up on that scale for a sec?
Okay, why? Am I gaining weight?
I have been working like crazy, eating like crap.
I haven't been exercising at all, really, so--
Yeah, look at that.
You are an inch shorter than you were this time last year.
You're shrinking, my friend.
How is that possible?
Well, you just told me. It's your unhealthy lifestyle, Richard.
It's a loss of mineral bone density.
- So, what do I do? - I'm gonna put you on calcium supplements,
and I'm gonna have you come back in about three weeks.
I'll see you then... or whatever's left of you.
So, Erlich, good news:
Keenan Feldspar signed his term sheet,
and we are now officially
negotiating the finer points of his deal.
Fantastic! Well, now the real work begins.
To that end, we would like to clarify our arrangement with you.
We feel that a generous finder's fee
will be more than satisfactory.
This meeting is over.
This is very generous, but I-- I was under the impression
that, um, I was going to be hired here,
and I've actually told quite a few people that I was hired,
so if I wasn't, then it would look like I was fired.
That is fine.
No. Laurie...
I will not allow you to make the same mistake
that Uber, Palantir, Zenefits,
and, in my earlier years, Chipotle made by not hiring me.
All right, don't hire me.
But can you hack this finder's fee into 52 installments,
paid weekly over the course of the next year?
You mean... A salary?
Those are your words, not mine.
The finder's fee and...
10,000 to go away?
You know, looking around at Bream-Hall,
I see a lot of the same:
- the same gender-- - Both partners happen to be female, Erlich.
Great catch. What's your point?
There is a grotesque gender imbalance in the VC field right now.
I can help you navigate the toxicity
of this male culture which is encroaching on our feminist island.
I mean, for instance, there's something called mansplaining?
- Have you heard about this? - We know what mansplaining is.
Mansplaining is when a man will condescendingly explain
something to a woman that she already knows.
Mr. Bachman, we have work to do.
All right. Laurie...
half the finder's fee for me to stay.
I don't think that you'll find an associate, um...
with my track record at a better price.
It's my final offer. Take it or leave it.
I need this.
Fine. You may start from Monday.
Okay. Ooh, this Monday?
That's fine. Of course.
What's that?
SonicWall SonicPoint ACe...
paired with the TZ600.
Top-of-the-line firewall protection,
built-in intrusion prevention, SSL decryption and inspection,
application control, and content filtering.
Saying new router would be so much quicker.
Dinesh, the one good thing
that came out of you slapping your body
against that cyberterrorist in a vulgar parody of the act of love
is that we finally have a network with real security value.
Why would we need it? Mia is in a federal facility
with no access to the Internet.
Right, and she has never shown
a proclivity for getting around infrastructure.
Did you see this? We've only been live for two weeks,
and we just cracked the top 500 in the Hooli app store.
Oh, look at that. Ranked 499.
Of utilities.
Yeah, subgroup mobile, subgroup storage.
True, but overall,
we're firmly in the top 30,000 Hooli phone apps.
I mean, we may not be a global epidemic yet,
but... we've leapt from bat saliva to humans
and-- and we've just killed our first few villagers.
This warm. This warm.
This warm.
- This warm. - I get it, Jian-Yang!
The refrigerator is broken.
The ice cream is melting.
Let me guess. Is it because it's warm?
- Yes. - Fine, I'll call the repairman,
and he'll come here and fix it posthaste.
No, I want a new fridge, a smarter fridge...
like this.
Fourteen thousand dollars for a smart fridge?
Unlike you, I now work for a living.
I'm not gonna drop that kind of dough on a fridge.
I ordered it already. I buy it for myself.
Then why are you talking to me about it?
To make you feel bad,
because you are fat and poor.
- Go for Erlich. - E. Bachman! E. Chen.
Got your message. Bream-Hall, huh?
Yes, starting today.
I hope that this doesn't create any tension between us,
us now being competitors and all.
None-zo.
Hey, while I have you, some of the boys are part
of the ownership group of the Warriors.
We have an extra spot on the floor at Oracle Arena.
You a hoops guy?
Sorry, you broke up.
Could you, uh, could you say that again?
We have an extra spot on the floor tonight at Oracle Arena.
You a hoops guy?
What red-blooded American male in the VC boys' club isn't?
Okay. Cool. I'll text you the deets.
Later, man.
Well, boys, I've been in the VC game for just one day,
and already I have floor seats to watch the Warriors.
- But you hate basketball. - I'll concede that spending all
my time inside of a house with you scrawny code jockeys,
the Incredible Shrinking Hendricks,
and whatever the fuck Jared is here...
...may have blunted my conventional masculinity
a hair, but it's always been there.
Well, try and get a selfie with Steph Curry.
I will, assuming she's there.
Jared, um, look at this e-mail here.
"Dear Richard, I recently became aware of your Space Saver app.
I think your app may infringe upon my own patented technology.
If your schedule permits,
I would love to discuss this with you as soon as possible.
Sincerely, Stewart Burke."
I thought we handled that patent stuff. We own it, right?
Yeah. I'll-- I'll send him
a harshly worded cease-and-desist letter.
Actually, uh...
his work address is some house in Mountain View.
He's probably just working out of his garage, just like us.
Why don't I go over there, walk him through the app,
you know, coder to coder. I'm sure it'll be fine.
You've got a big heart.
Or maybe it just seems big 'cause the rest of him is shrinking.
Hi. Richard Hendricks.
We exchanged e-mails?
- No. - Are-- are you Stewart Burke?
- No. - I'm sorry. Does Stewart Burke live here?
Yeah.
Okay. Is he in? Can I speak with him?
Grandpa! Some guy's here!
My grandson is the software expert.
I couldn't tell a computer from a toaster.
Oh. So, you're not a coder?
Oh no, not at all. I am an attorney.
I started out in the medical field,
then in the auto industry, and then the music business.
Did you represent all these people?
No, I sued them.
Look, that's me with Stevie Wonder.
He never saw it coming.
- You get it? - Uh, yes, because he's blind.
Right.
I'm sorry. I don't know what this... has to do with--
You see this?
This is a song I bought at a copyright auction.
It's an old mariachi number
that had cost me practically nothing
and so far has bought me two houses
and put my village idiot grandson through six years of Emerson.
Oh. All that from "Cancion de Amores"?
Was it a popular song?
No. I used the copyright on this song
to sue writers of all kinds of songs.
Anyway, the writers usually settle, pay me off,
or give me a chunk of their song.
Thanks to "Cancion de Amores" here,
I now own 10 percent of
Katrina and the Waves' "Walking on Sunshine."
It's a classic!
And when it runs next month
on Mazda's new Super Bowl spot, I print money.
But sadly, all the good music copyrights are gone.
That is... so sad.
And that's why I moved into tech.
And now, I sue people like you.
What?
So, he's a patent troll?
Yep, as like in buy a ton of super-broad IP
from failed startups at auction,
and then threaten litigation against accused infringers,
i.e., you.
So, uh, how much is Burke asking for?
Twenty thousand dollars.
Ah, you're getting off easy.
Well, no. Look, his patent covers...
"Storage of media files on a network."
I mean, that cannot be enforceable.
It's probably not...
But to find out, you're gonna have to fight him in court.
For a good litigator, we're talking at least...
a couple hundred grand.
Just pay him the 20 grand, Richard.
I could get creative
and take some money out of the Melcher deal.
There you go.
No, we need that money.
This is a shakedown. He's a crook.
And right when our app was getting off the ground.
That's how he found you.
Guys just landed on the app store
- top 500 list, right? - Yeah.
So, Burke starts at the bottom of those lists
and works his way up.
The more settlements he gets,
the stronger his case.
The higher you are on the list, the more money he asks for.
It's like-- it's like limp biscuit.
He sued those guys too?
Not the band.
The thing the band is named after.
Limp biscuit's an old frat ritual,
where all the brothers race to
stroke one out onto a biscuit,
and then the last guy to nut has to eat it.
Right. Sometimes it's a Wheat Thin.
Look, Richie, I get it.
It's embarrassing to pull your pud
in front of the whole pledge class.
Just pay the guy.
Or...
maybe... we convince the entire pledge class
to not play the game at all in the first place.
If only.
This must be the new fridge.
- You like this? - Look, it has a screen
so you can see all the food that's inside.
Kind of like that one?
This one has an app,
so you can actually watch the food on your phone.
All it needs to do
is keep my fucking beer cold.
You're running low on beer.
Fuck you.
Did you forget to scan that bar code?
Yes, I did... on purpose.
There we go.
It's bad enough it has to talk.
Does it need fake vocal ticks like, "Ah"?
Well, it just makes it sound more human.
Humans are shit.
This thing is addressing problems that don't exist.
It's solutionism at its worst.
We are dumbing down machines that are inherently superior.
Whatever. You gave your server a human name.
You named it Anton.
Yeah, but Anton doesn't call me anything.
He grimly does his work, then he sits motionless
till it's time to work again.
We could all take a page from his book.
That yogurt is expired.
See? This could've killed me.
Now I can give it to Erlich.
I'm not quite sure what you're doing.
Is there something I can help you with?
Yeah, how do I shut you the fuck up?
Is somebody having a rough day?
Did that fucker password-protect the settings?
His fridge, his rules.
Fuck.
My man, I was told I had a spot on the floor tonight,
but it seems that I've committed the cardinal sin of being early.
What time does the game actually start?
It's about to.
Wait. When he said, "a spot on the floor,"
did he mean... on the floor?
I wasn't a part of the conversation.
Come on, baby, come on! Come on, bring it! Unh!
I cannot do that.
All right, you guys go shirts.
We'll go skins.
And I can definitely not do that.
Will not.
Don't let him drive on you.
All day.
Yo, Erlich. Where you at, dawg?
Yo, what up, what up, what up?
Which one of you pussies, uh, put sugar in my gas tank
to prevent me from housing you on the hardwood?
- What? - Yeah, my car won't start.
It's a real fucked situation,
so I guess I'll have to
miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to--
We play every Tuesday.
I'll see you next week, bro-seph.
Let me get in. Let me get in. Let me get in.
Hey, I squished those front-end bugs.
- Did you finish your networking issue? - Nope.
I'm sorry. Wrong password.
You're sitting here, trying to hack Jian-Yang's password
instead of doing your actual work?
Well, good luck, it's a 10-digit alphanumeric.
Ten digit? Fuck.
And you have one underpowered laptop,
so you know, you should have the answer in...
9,000 years.
Time to pull out the big gun.
Well, maybe you should pull out the bug gun...
'cause of the network bug.
As in the bug you're supposed to be fixing.
If you were programmed to
have a good sense of humor, you'd laugh at that.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see any Good Humor ice cream bars.
Shall I add them to your shopping list?
You know what? Yeah.
Good Humor ice cream bars
- added to your shopping list. - Come on.
God. You believe this? I'm-- I'm still on hold.
- With? - Microsoft Azure.
Yeah, I-- I'm trying to negotiate a lower cloud storage rate
because we're gonna need it if,
or more realistically when,
Richard finally decides to pay that patent troll.
I mean, I'm still on hold.
It's like they don't even care about small businesses.
Jared, they don't care about small businesses.
That's why small businesses have to lie.
Like, um, Google named their first building Building 40,
so that people would think they were already huge.
When I worked at my first startup,
I would transfer people to "My supervisor,"
and then I'd just get back on the phone myself.
Yeah, hello.
No, no, I'm not gonna go on hold again.
In fact, could I transfer you to my supervisor?
No, no, no, I have to take a shit.
Just, um... do your best Ed Chen impression.
One moment please.
What's up? You got Ed Ch-- Chambers.
Hello, everybody. Thanks again for making it.
And thanks to Gus of Gigglybots for hosting.
No problem.
My name is, uh, Richard Hendricks, uh, of Pied Piper.
You're the guys working for Gavin Belson.
Was working with Gavin Belson, yeah.
- So, he's not coming? - No. No, not at all.
But I'll have you all know
that without any involvement from Gavin Belson,
Pied Piper, just like yourselves,
has reached the Hooli app store's top 500 list,
and you guys are aware
that you are all directly above us on the list,
which is why you should know that a patent troll
named Stewart Burke has recently demanded
that I pay a $20,000 licensing fee,
and if I pay,
he's gonna come and ask you guys for more money.
He starts with the little guy.
Not that I'm little. I'm, uh...
I mean I'm not.
I'm actually, uh...
above average height.
Isn't this something that could have been done over e-mail?
I mean, I guess, but-- look.
If we don't stop this guy,
he's gonna just keep asking for more and more money
until someone is stuck with an unpayable bill.
It's kind of like that old fraternity game,
the limp biscuit.
Sorry, I wasn't in a fraternity. What is that?
I-I-- I don't think we need to get into--
It's where guys stand in a circle and masturbate onto a cracker.
And then the last guy... eats it.
What?
- Again, I-- again-- - I don't really know
why he would mention that. It's super gross.
Is this why Gavin Belson stopped working with you?
No.
The important thing is here,
my lawyer has actually drafted a partnership agreement.
Why don't you all just... Essentially, uh,
we all band together and each contribute $20,000.
We should have more than enough money
to mount a challenge against this guy's patent.
And if we win, we dissolve the patent,
so that he can't do this to anyone else ever again.
Because in the end,
shouldn't it be Mr. Stewart Burke, the patent troll,
who is forced to eat the biscuit?
I'm pretty sure that's sexual assault.
Yeah, no one deserves that.
I know. That-- that's all I'm saying.
Look, I'm pretty sure it's even made up.
Like, you know, like a donkey punch, you know?
Again, what is a donkey punch?
- It's, uh, when guys-- - Just don't. Don't.
G-man, you busy at the moment?
Very. I'm about to set Anton loose
on that talking chrome beer coozy.
So, care to take a breather and...
help a pal throw a basketball hoop on the old garage?
Why would you need help
from a scrawny code jockey such as myself?
Fine.
I'm perfectly capable of figuring it out myself.
All I need is-- Ah!
May I borrow this hammer
to pound in these flamboyant little nails?
- Those are screws. - Yeah, no, I...
Jared Dunn.
Yep, just a moment, please. I'll transfer you.
Go for Chambers.
Ned! I knew it was you.
Hey, did that pussy Jared keep you on hold long?
I eat that motherfucker's lunch every day.
No, man, I literally eat his food. What do you want?
Uh-uh, ain't gonna happen.
That's as high as we go, homo.
Till next time, rook.
I mean, did you see that? He's amazing.
- Who? - Ed Chambers.
He got Pied Piper
a great cloud storage rate from Azure,
and he's got the hookup on a couple of pallets
of pamplemousse LaCroix at,
his words, an amaze-balls price.
Good job, Jared.
Well, I mean, don't congratulate me. Congratulate Ed Chambers.
- Ed Chambers is you. - Well, I wish, but--
Gentlemen. You all said that it couldn't be done,
but it appears as if Sir Richard the Not-Short
hath now slain the slimy troll.
Stu Burke. R. Hendricks.
I got word that you called.
I assume you spoke with my attorney, Monsieur Ron Laflamme?
Yes, I did speak to Ron Laflamme.
What, pray tell, did he tell you when he called you?
Well, I called him, actually,
to tell him that the eight companies
you apparently tried to organize against me
have reached out to me preemptively to settle.
And because I appreciated that,
I offered them a very, very reasonable rate.
So, Richard Hendricks, fuck you.
Okay. Uh, yeah.
I understand.
So, you're firm on that?
Well, bye then.
- So, your coalition fucked us? - Yes.
So, now we have to pay the $20,000?
Not exactly. Because he...
Stu is saying that since all eight companies
have now licensed the patent,
he has a stronger case against us,
so, um, he'd actually like m-more money.
- How much? - Three hundred thousand dollars.
So, we just ate the Wheat Thin, didn't we?
I'm sorry. I didn't see any Wheat Thins.
Shall I add them to your shopping list?
Sure.
Well, let's hope that Melcher doesn't hear about all this.
You guys don't need all these lights on, do you?
Yes, we do.
Okay. Well, that should be fine. We should be fine.
Um, fine from what?
That fridge is putting up a fight,
so I'm gonna have to try something with Anton.
Might put a little strain on the wiring, that's all.
I'll be in the garage.
Hey, Richard, but you're not
seriously gonna defend yourself in court, right?
Well, Larry Flynt did it.
And Sir Walter Raleigh,
although he lost and was publicly beheaded.
But you could argue that
he eventually won in the court of history.
I get it. I should've settled. Okay?
And I didn't.
And you're right, I will probably lose,
but I'm not going down without a fight.
And I've got all of Monahan's discovery
from the Hooli case right here,
so that's something.
Oh my God.
This is from high school.
These are all my notes
from the original build of Pied Piper 1.0,
back when it was just some
stupid search app for music copyright...s.
Hold on. Hold on.
What the fuck?
Sorry. Everybody okay?
I don't know, you fucking maniac!
- Are we? - Probably.
Richard? What-- what are you up to?
About six foot two, Jared.
Looks like I can slay that troll after all.
What am I looking at?
Well, you said that you used "Cancion de Amores"
to sue musicians,
claimed that they stole that song, right?
Bought two houses, put Jeremy through four years of college.
Six, and he's still 20 credits short.
Okay, well, he may want to consider financial aid,
because that little song there
was itself stolen from an old country song
called "I'm Cryin'" parentheses "with my eyes."
from 1967, a full eight years before "Cancion de Amores."
And I'm pretty sure Katrina and the Waves would want to know
that they gave you a piece of "Walking on Sunshine" for nothing.
Mazda may want to pull that whole Super Bowl spot.
- Bullshit. - No, no, not bullshit.
Computer science.
Yeah, and we can take it to court if you like,
see who they believe:
perhaps the most advanced
and sophisticated pattern-matching algorithm
ever devised by a fucking genius
or some old asshole who once sued Stevie Wonder.
All right. What do you want, you little prick?
Correction, sir.
I am a big prick.
Hello, my cold friend.
Hello?
Suck it, Jian-Yang.
You attack and destroy my refrigerator?
And you misspell my name.
I did. I had to overclock Anton,
but I was able to brute-force the backdoor password
to that chrome piece of shit in under 12 hours.
And I added a little visual flair.
Suck it, Jian-Yang.
- So? - So... he bought it. Hook, line and sinker.
Yeah, he thinks the search results are real.
You trolled the troll.
Yeah, yeah, for a second there, he wasn't buying it,
and then I just started babbling on about tech specs
until his eyes glazed over.
Well, as a result, we now have
a perpetual royalty-free license for the patent.
- Yes! - See? I stuck to my guns and as a result,
we now have 20 grand we would have otherwise lost
if I had listened to you delicate little snowflakes and settled.
Yeah? Twenty grand.
Yeah, so let me cum into a bucket and have you all drink it.
Richard? Could I have a-- a moment?
Sorry about that.
I-I-I-- I regretted it the second it came out of my mouth.
Richard. Well, yes, but...
- Here. - What's this?
that is a bill from Ron Laflamme
for the paperwork he had to do
to put your coalition of companies together.
Twenty-two thousand dollars?
Yeah. It's at the high end of standard.
So, it would've cost us slightly less if we'd have just...
Paid the troll? Well, that's true,
but can you put a price on dignity?
Apparently, I just did.
Do me a favor and don't tell the guys.
- Yeah. You have my utmost discretion. - Thank you.
Speaking of, Richard, I need to tell you something.
I had to let Ed Chambers go.
- Who? - My fictional supervisor.
He bragged to a sales rep
at LaCroix about doing it
to Sonia Sotomayor,
so Ed is no longer with us.
I'm sure we can manage.
He also was never actually with us.
- Right. - 'Cause he was never real.
Out of sight, out of mind.
- And out of reality. - Yeah, well.
Ed Chambers.
Don't hit-- No, no, no, no! Oh!
Fuck!
Yeah, a lot of these guys aren't man enough
to work for an all-female led VC firm,
but not me.
I believe that the future is female.
And anyone who says otherwise can suck my fat dick.
Bachman, scoreboard.
Scoreboard. Fuck. Shit.
Who made that one through the--
It was a three-pointer, dumbass!
Three-pointer? What, are we in Europe?
Pass!
- Is he fucking with me? - Shoot it!
A little to the right. The right more. More.
More. Woof! Aces.
- We did it. - Busy?
Come on in.
I'm just putting the finishing touches
on Bachman's Operational Center.
Can you believe that I talked the ladies
into letting me keep that little piece of genius in here?
- Sweet. - Sweet indeed. It's human hair.
Where have you been?
We've been trying to close your deal.
Monica and Laurie are really fighting me
on one final deal point,
and I was getting bummed, so I turned my phone off,
went kitesurfing in Fiji.
When I got back, I was chill again,
and I got a message that they agreed.
So, you closed?
Yep!
What was that one little, pesky deal point?
I think you're gonna like it.
Fuck yeah!
A keyman clause?
Yes, and said keyman is none other than yours truly.
It's the highest honor that you can bestow on a VC.
So, you get shares in the company.
- No. - So, you get a seat on the board.
I do not.
A bonus?
There's no cash involved,
but if Monica or Laurie
tries to oust me from Bream-Hall,
Keenan Feldspar can void the deal and walk.
So, basically, this new title just means that you,
for sure, get to keep your shitty desk job.
Congratulations, but, Erlich,
can you please turn on the heat?
It's freezing in here.
Tsk-tsk, Richard. Negativity.
Hey, have you seen Keenan's demo?
Reddit is shitting itself over it.
Of course I've seen it. I'm his keyman.
He gave me one of the first opportunities to shit myself over it.
- It's that good? - Guys, come on.
How good can it be? VR is just a fad.
Richard. I've forgotten
what an envious little crone you can be.
Envious? Me? Of who? Keenan Feldspar?
Of course. Keenan was born with a golden horseshoe up his ass,
while you sit here toiling away in an icebox
you call your home office,
cursed with the Midas touch of shit.
I'm not cursed,
and the icebox you're referring to is your house, okay?
What?
Guys, I just got a billing alert from Azure.
Apparently, all of our cold data has gone hot,
so we've already exceeded our monthly server budget.
Monthly? Bullshit. It's been four days.
What the fuck?
We have to store Melcher's data there
until we have enough phones.
We can't afford this.
I'm gonna call Melcher.
Richard. How we doing?
Is there something going on with your data?
Because it was basically parked until a few hours ago
when it started flying on and off our network like crazy.
Well, aren't you-- aren't you watching the weather channel?
No, why? Is there a hurricane or something?
- Worse. It's cold outside. - Okay. So?
California looses its mind when it gets cold.
Citrus trees start freezing.
Sometimes there's actual frost on the road,
you know, then people start filing claims like crazy.
Our whole office is going nuts right now.
Well, that kind of data traffic is costing us a fortune.
That's the beauty of the deal we made, Richard.
You agreed to store our data for a flat rate.
Everyone else in my division is getting gouged
on their storage and bandwidth fees right now,
but thanks to you, I look like a genius.
- I'll tell Liz you say hi. - Oh. Oh no.
No, no, that's okay.
- What did he say? - He says hi.
And that we are responsible for the overages.
Fuck! Maybe you are cursed.
I'm not. That's ridiculous.
There's no such thing.
Fucking what?
Richard, a bill of this size is going to be problematic.
Problematic?
Catastrophic. We're not gonna be able to pay that bill,
so our server's gonna get cut off,
which means we're gonna lose Melcher's data,
which means he's gonna sue us
and seize our assets and our patents,
and the entire future of the fucking Internet
is gonna belong to a fucking insurance company!
I can't take this shit anymore!
Admit it! We're fucked.
Okay, let's just think. Let's just think.
Dan Melcher runs a very conservative insurance company,
but even he was willing
to pay us up front for data storage, right?
True. Although, that was complicated.
- What? - It-- it's just a such a in-the-weeds deal.
Point being, we can find another customer,
and then use that upfront payment to cover Melcher's fees.
That's like getting a new credit card
to pay off your old credit card.
Yeah, and as CFO,
I should tell you we've already done that seven times.
Look, I don't have any moral issue with any of that,
but it was hard enough to get Melcher.
How the fuck are we gonna get a second Melcher?
It's cold out here.
Can almost see my breath, huh?
What do you want?
it's just that the guys are a little agitated,
because we seem to be having minor money troubles.
I was thinking since you and Bream-Hall signed
such a big check over to Keenan Feldspar
and since you are his keyman,
maybe you could help set up a data storage deal
like we had with Melcher?
Merely tens of minutes ago,
you were rubbing VR's face in a pile of its own make--
that means shit--
and now VR is supposed to be your lifeboat?
Just to remind you, Erlich,
you are also an investor in Pied Piper.
It would be good for everyone, including you.
Very well.
Fill me in on the details of your little proposal.
Pitch.
What do you mean?
You-- you know the details.
You were there with me for every single pitch meeting.
And I'm sorry that I wasn't key in those meetings,
so I don't recall all of the little nitty-gritty details.
...Saving you 25 percent on your data storage,
which makes us pretty deserving of the Weissman trophy.
You know, the Heisman trophy from athletics.
Dude. This demo is insane.
Gentlemen, you're stepping on Richard's laughs.
I'm sorry, but I walked up a hill,
and on top of the hill, there was a tavern.
And I walked into the tavern
and I could just look everywhere,
and there was a barmaid.
Guess what. I walked right up to the barmaid,
and I just looked at her for a really long time.
This technology could change the world.
I'm not one to gush,
but the possibilities of your consequence-free reality
are darkly promising.
So stoked you guys liked it.
I hacked it together last summer
and I just guessed right on a lot of the details.
But if you think that was cool,
wait till you see our final hardware,
which is en route from China.
It's gorgeous.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,
just 'cause, you know, this can be a tough business.
Is it? So, Richard...
...you wanna try the demo?
No thanks. No, I'm-- I'm not a VR guy.
Richard doesn't like things that are cool or fun or taste good.
Plus, it makes him queasy.
He has a sensitive constitution.
Come on. You're gonna do it.
Look at him. He's gonna do it.
It's gonna be awesome! Come on! You're doing it!
- Come on, come on. - Okay, sure. I guess. Fine.
- After you. - Okay.
You really vomited a lot...
- and, like, immediately. - Yeah. Yeah.
- Bad luck, I guess. - Yeah, so...
Look, anyway, about that data storage deal?
Yeah. If Erlich says it works,
that's good enough for me. Let's do it.
- Really? Okay. - Yeah.
Perfect. That's great.
Well, I guess we should get back to the house,
draw up some paperwork for that.
We should be able to pull everything together by Monday.
Is it cool if we hang out, just to,
like, play around with the VR some more?
Okay, but I'm sure Keenan's busy.
Nah! You guys should stay.
You want a beer? I just put in a fresh keg.
He put in a fresh keg.
It's so warm in here.
That would be the subfloor heating.
I didn't even know I had it.
It just came with the house.
That's nice.
What are you telling me? Box Two is delayed?
We were already facing some design and production challenges,
but then this cold snap happened.
Apparently there was frost on the loading dock
at our microprocessor plant in Acton.
So, it's cold outside.
Why does everyone in this state have to be such a wimp about it?
Well, a semitruck slid right through the door
and hit the main breaker panel
and melted down the entire facility.
The driver was incinerated, instantly.
I see. Well, our thoughts and prayers, obviously,
but we'll still be ready to roll out in time for Hoolicon, right?
Guys.
I'm not Gavin Belson.
You can be honest with me?
How many days will this set us back?
We're going to miss delivery of product...
by two quarters.
You realize Hoolicon is in one week, right?
I mean, it's my first Hoolicon as CEO of this company.
I... I'm supposed to get up on stage,
in front of an audience of thousands,
and deliver a keynote presentation
built entirely around the release of Box Two!
I was going to descend onto the stage,
in a giant box.
Boom!
Jack-in-the-box.
Then Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather
were gonna come out and box
over who was gonna get to take home the first new box!
These are world-class puns! Now I got nothing!
Hello?
Guys!
I have something to show you.
- Have you been here all weekend? - Is that the sushi guy?
Matching pajamas.
You guys look like you're in a cult.
Keenan gets these for free.
Yeah, we're not gonna wear the same thing three days straight.
You gotta come check this out.
This way!
I didn't feel sick at all, not once.
Not even going up the hill?
No. No, no nausea at all.
Yeah, I felt fine the entire time.
What'd you do? Did you reduce the latency?
I didn't. You did!
Dinesh and Gilfoyle helped me integrate
your middle-out compression algorithm into my codec.
I'm sorry. What?
It's off the charts now, man!
We were even able to push the barmaid to the cloud.
These two guys are mad geniuses.
Hang on. I have something for ya.
What the fuck?
You just gave our proprietary technology to this asshole
without even running it by me first?
Are you serious?
We were just hanging out,
and he was like, "We should try it,"
And he said we could delete it,
and then he started getting really excited.
And then he said, you know, "You're doing it,"
a bunch of times,
and then we did it.
And then we started getting really excited,
- and it was so exciting. - And it worked.
The VR is rad now.
Gilfoyle, "Rad"?
You are wearing the exact same pajamas as Dinesh,
and you're saying "Rad" now?
You have been sucked entirely into his little... Keenan vortex.
Okay.
I grant you, with...
the benefit of even a second's distance,
this isn't a good look.
I don't know. I think we look rad.
Just-- just hear Keenan out, okay?
- On what? - Here you go, Richard.
- What's this? - It's an offer.
I want to acquire Pied Piper.
Bingo-- 2009,
the HooliPad touchscreen was recalled
five days before Gavin Belson's Hoolicon keynote.
Now, if he can pull something together that fast,
certainly I can.
Well, sir, I really don't see the value
in you comparing yourself so closely to Gavin Belson.
Meaning what exactly?
Nothing. Just that...
he's considered the greatest showman
the tech world has ever seen.
I mean, just look at him.
We've blown away
the FIPS 140-2 standard for security,
and that's been certified by NIST/CSE,
as you can see...
There.
Look at the confidence, the poise.
Look at the stage presence.
...is accessible-- here we go--
through the drop-down menu...
- there. - How could I top that?
I don't think anyone ever will.
When he looked at you,
you felt like you were the only two people in the world.
Hoover.
Yes, sir.
Get the fuck out of my office this instant.
Sorry, sir.
Anyone here use our enterprise server?
We've taken secure authentication
- to a whole other level. - Jack Barker...
you're gonna need a miracle.
Anyone care to talk secure biometrics?
Well, considering our looming debts,
and the embryonic state of our network,
this is a very generous offer.
But we're not for sale, guys.
Richard, listen, it's like we've been lost at sea
for a long time on a tiny boat,
and there is no wind.
And now, through sheer luck,
we've just happen to drift right up to Hawaii.
Now, we can continue sailing into the unknown,
and probably sink
or die of starvation or scurvy,
or we can get off in Hawaii.
Let's get off in Hawaii.
- What's so good about Hawaii? - Have you never been?
- No. - It's very nice.
I think we should take it.
Okay, everything Keenan touches turns to gold,
and you...
are different than that.
I want to go to Hawaii.
Fucking Keenan Feldspar.
How dare he put me in this position?
Everything just comes so easy to him.
He invents one little thing,
and then he's gonna make a billion dollars,
and just, "Oh,
Keenan Feldspar gets whatever he wants,"
and now I have to be the ogre that says no to him.
Great.
Richard, you are my captain,
and I'm your mate.
And I will sleep in the bilge with the vermin,
and I will eat hardtack, and I will say, "Thank you."
And if duty requires, I will stand on deck,
and I will salute you as we sink beneath the waves.
But as poor as our odds are,
I'm worried that if we turn down this offer,
we will lose the rest of our crew,
and if that happens,
you will lose everything, Richard.
Your algorithm.
So, you're saying that
if I say no to this...
I risk having a mutiny on my hands.
Aye, Captain.
Thanks.
Fuck you, Keenan Feldspar.
Problem?
Your counter offer here is really, really high.
Yes, but after crunching the old numbies, um,
there's no way we could make an acquisition work
for even just a penny less than that number right there,
you know, what with the patent and the IP.
And you said yourself, my guys are the best.
So, Keenan, as you know, the best is expensive.
This is more than I just took in funding from Bream-Hall,
and you want all cash.
- I can't do that. - Really?
Rats. Rats, rats, rats.
Weird.
I wanted this to happen, but it didn't.
That sucks. I wanted it too, very badly.
But, um... you know, what they say in life,
"You can't always get what you want."
This feeling sucks.
Trust me, you get used to it.
Wait. Keenan said no?
- To us? - I guess you can never really know someone
until you ask them to put their money where their mouth is.
You know, kind of a shitty thing to do.
Kind of a shitty little dude.
Anyway, well, lesson learned.
Anyhoo, as soon as Erlich comes in
and brings us our signed data storage contract from Keenan,
we'll be all set. We'll be back in business.
Go team. Let's celebrate.
Let's-- let's put on some music. We never do that.
What was the number?
- What number? - Your counteroffer to Keenan.
What was the number you went back to him with?
Well, Gilfoyle, to be honest, these deals are pretty complicated.
Richard, what was the number?
Twenty-five million fucking dollars.
Wait. What?
You heard the man-child right.
Richie had the quail eggs to counter 25 million.
Isn't that right, Richard?
What? That's fucking crazy.
Yeah, I thought so too,
but you know what's even crazier than that?
You guys got yourself a fucking deal!
What?
Okay, so this is $25 million? This is real?
- As crystal. - Yeah, I'm-- I'm not gonna lie,
when you first told me that number,
I had a feeling of mad.
But then I had lunch, and after that I was a little tired,
but I mostly felt pretty okay.
And that's when it hit me.
This is a guy who knows how valuable he is!
It got me to thinking that
perhaps I had undervalued my own company,
especially because now I have this baller algorithm
that's solving all my latency issues.
- Well, my algorithm. - So, I called Big Cat here,
and we slid that new demo over to Raviga.
Ed Chen liked it so much,
he offered to triple the Bream-Hall deal.
But the Bream-Hall deal is signed. It's done, right?
Was done.
Enter the keyman, the big cat.
You see, if I quit Bream-Hall,
then Keenan is free to do whatever he wants.
- You quit Bream-Hall? - Two hours ago.
Ten minutes later, we were in a handshake deal at Raviga.
This adorable little wombat made clear his intentions
that he wants me to be the new COO
of his company, along with a five percent stake.
And now, we can all work together on this dope-ass shit
and make a fuck-ton of money while we're doing it!
See? It always works out.
It does. Who's drinking? To the palapa! Yeah!
Pour me one, Big Cat!
Jared, there's no pink glasses!
Richard,
On it.
I know you think I'm a bullshit artist.
It's okay. I totally am.
I have this gift where I can make people do
whatever I want 'em to do,
- and they don't even realize they're doing it. - Right.
Richard, you have the greatest technology that I've ever seen.
You can change the fucking world.
You just have to get people excited about it.
That's where I come in. You and me together, bro?
Look how strong this is. Fucking forget about it.
We're gonna be fucking cutting class and crushing ass.
You really think
that you can get people excited about Pied Piper?
Richard, that's what I do.
You know you're doing it. Oh, I can see it.
He knows. The wheels are already turning.
- Maybe. - Come on, you're fucking doing it!
Let's do it, buddy! Let's fucking do it!
- Come on! - Well, okay.
- Jared, here we go. - Oh, I'm just gonna wait.
- Okay, here you are. - Yeah!
Get out there!
- Richard? - Yeah.
Are-- are we okay?
No, Jared, we're-- we're not okay.
We're fucking rich.
Sorry, it's a bit nutty around here.
Yeah. Well, I just wanna say,
how sorry I am that Erlich flaked on you guys.
- Not your fault. - Also...
and I know this might piss you off to some degree,
I have decided to make a deal with Keenan Feldspar.
What? Why?
He made a... really good offer.
Lots of money, and... he's got my back, so.
Right, well, it's not like him to talk you into a deal
and then just totally fuck you over.
Yeah. No. Look, he's copped up to all that.
I mean, he was very honest
about the whole Keenan vortex thing, so.
Well, you don't think his discussing the vortex
is just a way of pulling you into the vortex?
No. Wh-why would he-- wh...
Son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Okay, look, Richard,
what I'm about to tell you is a huge breach of ethics,
but it's gonna save you from making a big mistake.
Keenan and Erlich's little keyman game
is the greatest thing that happened to this firm.
- I'd like to hear why. - A, no more Erlich.
And if that weren't enough, we get our $20 million back.
But the biggest reason is that
we realized once we took a look under the hood,
Keenan's tech is dog shit.
No. No, it's not dog shit.
I thought so too, but then I tried the demo,
and it's pretty amazing. There's this point in the tavern,
where you meet this barmaid,
and you can look wherever you want,
however long you want.
Yeah, well, um, look, the demo is amazing...
when you run it on a $10,000 rig.
But the future of VR is mobile,
and there's no phone on Earth that could handle that demo,
let alone the full-bloated platform.
Isn't that why Keenan has acquired us?
I mean, to help him figure that out?
No, he just wants you to make the demo better
so he can take as much money off the table as he can.
He'll walk away rich, the company will crater,
and you will go down with it,
and that would be the end of Pied Piper.
Richard, you have to tell Keenan
that you're not gonna take this deal.
Fuck. What do I do?
How am I supposed to tell the guys
that I'm taking away their payday?
You don't understand. Keenan had us pouring champagne
all over each other like a bunch of fucking douchebags.
I honestly don't think they even care that the tech is shit.
They just want to go to Hawaii.
- Hawaii? - It's a metaphor we've been using.
We're pirates, and our ship is sinking,
and Keenan is Hawaii.
This is what you talk about all day?
Look. This deal was our only hope,
and, with all due respect, you run your own firm,
and you're not exactly
chomping at the chance to fund us, are you?
Because you're still theoretical.
Look, I'll make you a promise.
If you can get all of Melcher's data
onto a stable network of mobile devices
and prove that this works,
I will fund your "A" round.
- Really? - You have my word,
but you have to tell Keenan no deal.
Guys?
He came in the front this time.
So, we need to talk to you.
You need to talk to me?
You may want to have a seat.
Okay.
Is that a new... sweater?
Hey, Richard, there's some bad news.
Richard, right before Keenan signed the Raviga deal,
somebody else swooped in and offered him
an absurd amount of money for his company,
- And he took it. - Really?
So, Keenan sold his company.
Deal's off the table.
We're not going to Hawaii.
No.
Oh no.
Listen, Richard, we know you
fought really hard for this deal.
We will never forget that.
Yeah, I did, and I would gladly fight
for it and you guys again.
Gosh damn.
You don't seem that mad.
I am. I am, Gilfoyle. I'm pissed.
If-- if you need to kick another hole in the door,
- we'd understand. - Oh yeah. No, I-- I might.
I might have to. Really, I just...
If I don't calm down, I will.
I will take you up on that.
Who, uh...
- Who did he sell to? - The only other company
that could guarantee viable middle-out compression.
- Hooli. - Yup.
Hooli. He sold to Hooli.
What a dick move.
Yeah, I mean, that's not the half of it.
I mean, once he figured out
what Erlich's five percent would be worth,
he left him out in the cold.
Wait. He-- he got Erlich to quit his job
and then cut him out of the deal?
Jesus.
We thought you were cursed,
but maybe it was just your proximity to Erlich.
I mean, that dude must've driven a van
over a bunch of gypsies in a previous life.
Where is he?
I saw him grab his lighter and his bong
and head out to the palapa to sulk a few minutes ago.
Isn't that his bong right there?
Well, shit.
Guys, there's a fire!
We need the fire guys.
Someone call the fire guys!
Erlich!
Hey, buddy.
Still not talking, huh?
You've been out here all night. It's freezing.
You sure you don't wanna come back inside?
Yeah, it was a nice palapa.
Well, concrete's still pretty warm from the fire.
He should be okay for at least a few more hours.
Well, that's probably longer than we'll be in business.
Yeah, we got our first past-due notice from Azure.
They said we have five business days till they cut us off.
If you guys wanna feel worse...
check this out.
Come join us for an epic gathering
where we come together as one people, as visionaries.
Is this not the most exciting time to be in technology?
The whole thing is just like, "Wow."
The most transformative technology event in the world.
Hoolicon.
See you all at Hoolicon!
I hope you're excited. I know "Vee are."
Yeah, VR.
Fucking Keenan Feldspar.
Jared, how many people attend Hoolicon?
About a quarter of a million...
over the whole weekend.
And, Gilfoyle, um, how many more phones
do we need to get us off Azure?
A hundred and twenty-three thousand, give or take.
Dinesh, how much are tickets to Hoolicon?
Why would I have that information?
Just think about it.
On Saturday, over a quarter-million people
are gonna stream through that building.
A veritable who's who of nobodies.
Richard, we've tried marketing at trade shows.
We suck at it.
No, I'm not talking about that.
Let me ask you this:
We need 120,000 phones, right?
What is the first thing
people do when they get in there?
Log on to free Wi-Fi.
But Hooli makes you download
the Hoolicon app in order to sign in.
So, what if we
somehow hack our code onto the app?
Then we will have our 120,000 phones all in one day.
I'm sorry. You're-- you're talking about sneaking our code
onto people's phones without them even knowing about it?
I mean, that's malware, Richard.
No. No, no, no. Think of it more as, um,
forced adoption through aggressive guerrilla marketing.
Well, as a product of forced adoption,
I can assure you there are consequences.
- I like it. - Well, hold on.
Even if we get our code into that app and onto all those phones,
people are just gonna delete the app
as soon as the conference is over.
People don't delete apps.
I'm telling you. Get your phones out right now.
Uh, Hipstamatic.
Vine, may she rest in peace.
- NipAlert? - McCain/Palin.
All right, this works in theory,
but... penetrating the Hooli servers
to hack their shitty convention app?
We'd need a black hat ninja for this one.
I wonder where we can find someone like that.
No.
It's so great to see you, Mia.
- How's Pakistan? - It's so great.
I was there for a while, and as I said before,
I have to go back there right after this
for an extended period of time.
Anyway, how's all this stuff going?
You must be, like, dying of boredom.
I am, but the terms of my plea agreement
forbid me to touch a computer or go online, so.
Let me run a hypothetical by you,
just to, like, exercise your brain.
Like, for instance, if I had to hack the Hooli app servers,
mess with an app, and push it out over a venue's free Wi-Fi...
how would I do it?
It's a trick question, right?
Because you wouldn't hack the app server.
You'd just launch a man-in-the-middle attack with Pineapples.
Google it. Speaking of...
if they even catch me talking about this,
they could send me to maximum security prison,
but I think I found a way to get online.
- No. - There's a computer in the library
that's not supervised on Sundays.
I think if I can pull library duty, I'll be able to sneak on
and track down whoever ratted me out.
I am going to destroy that motherfucker.
Not if I destroy him first.
Excuse me. What's your policy on anonymous tips?
Fuck. Wi-Fi Pineapples. It's so obvious.
Not to me.
Look, we set up a bunch of these at Hoolicon.
We position ourselves
between everyone's devices and the real Wi-Fi.
So, they log onto our boxes
and our boxes log onto the real Wi-Fi?
- Exactly. - So, we show them a fake landing page,
and force everyone to
download a doctored version of the Hoolicon app.
And they'll never know the difference.
No wonder Mia's in prison. She's brilliant.
- I think this might actually work. - Wrong!
It'll never work.
You don't even know what we've been talking about.
I don't need to, Richard.
The truth is, we've tried and tried.
Every time we've gotten a whiff of success,
a giant pelican by the name of Fate
takes a four-and-a-half- pound shit right on top of us.
There are people who are destined for greatness
and people who are not.
Richard, it seems you and I... are not.
And so, I've had enough.
I'm ending it all tonight.
Suicide? I have a book for you.
No, Gilf. Last night, when I was sitting out there
by the smoldering husk of my palapa,
so cruelly taken away from me...
You burned it down yourself.
Which led me to my epiphany.
This epiphany.
"Greetings from Tibet. If you find yourself in Qamdo prefecture,
do drop in. Gavin Belson."
That was addressed to me.
No, that was addressed to "Richard Hendricks and company."
Company, of which I am a part.
You're not seriously thinking of going to Tibet?
You're broke. How the fuck are you gonna pay for that?
That's where you come in, my great friends.
I figured we might pass the hat?
Just give whatever you are comfortable with.
I'll pay for it, whatever it costs.
Well, it seems the smallest of us has the biggest heart.
Thank you, young Jinathon.
- Business class? - Premium economy.
You fly one way.
Don't you need a VISA to go to China?
Yes. I can call my uncle in Beijing.
He's very corrupt.
That sounded... ominous,
but, gents, it's as I was saying:
Where there's a will, there's a way...
just not for you guys.
- No, I will not help you on this mission. - No?
Richard, we always said we didn't want to end up like Hooli.
How are we like Hooli?
We are trying to give free Internet to the entire world.
If we have to bend a few rules here and there--
I mean, it's all for the greater good, is it not?
Gavin Belson started out with lofty goals too,
but he just kept excusing immoral behavior just like this,
until one day all that was left was a sad man
with funny shoes--
disgraced, friendless, and
engorged with the blood of a youthful charlatan.
I am never going to be...
any of that.
Richard, not that long ago,
you agonized over using a stolen log-in
to get into a bake-off with Endframe,
a company that stole from us.
But now you're, what, shrugging off
large-scale cybercrimes against innocent civilians?
It's a means to an end. It's not who I am.
I mean, Lincoln had to suspend habeas corpus to end the war,
- but he restored it after. - Lincoln?
Richard, it's not that easy.
There's always a next time and a next time and a next time.
I cannot knowingly contribute to your moral decay.
Well, what if you didn't do it... knowingly?
You're always telling me how you spent your entire childhood
pretending that everything going on around you was okay.
- Uncle Jerry's game. - Yeah, that.
Let's play Uncle Jerry's game.
Do you know what you're asking?
Okay, guys, how we looking?
One second. Almost done.
All 12 Pineapples tested and packed.
Jared, you can come in now.
All right, all of our swag is in the car,
and I look forward to a successful promotion
of our legitimate space-saving app.
Yup, that's what this is.
Whatever.
Well, now, gentlemen, this is it. Goodbye.
Obviously, I don't care to make a big deal out of it,
so I think it's sufficient just to go around
and each of you say a memory or two of times
where I've profoundly impacted your life.
- It doesn't have to be a profound impact. - We're leaving now.
- What? - International flight.
Four hours early.
- No, international flights are three hours early. - It's a new rule.
Gentlemen.
Okay, let's have some fun.
First hurdle down. We're past security.
That made me nervous, sneaking all that shit in.
Why? We're bringing tech to a tech convention.
When did Pied Piper get added to the vendor list?
C-4210.
That looks like us.
Oh no, that can't be.
No. This is not what I was promised.
- What? It's fine. - But they told me
that we would have prominent placement
with proximity to high-traffic corridor.
We're in the middle of the road here.
- So? - Yeah, who gives a fuck?
Well, Jared does, and-- and we do as well.
Uh, you know what? Why don't you go check out
what the bathroom situation's like?
Yes. Nothing would make me happier. Good.
You know, I actually believe him.
Okay.
So, gentlemen,
okay, while Jared's gone, let's get our bearings.
All right, so, we are here.
Now, you guys deploy the Pineapples.
Start with high-traffic areas, so that means entrances.
People are setting up equipment everywhere,
so it shouldn't look that unusual,
but be careful, don't get caught,
- and remember why we are here. - Richard?
Winnie.
Hello. Hi.
Yeah. Oh.
I haven't seen you since--
Since you threw yourself down a flight of stairs
to prove how smart you were.
That whole spaces-tab thing was...
Kind of petty?
Petty? No, I was gonna say
"Illustrative of our vast differences."
- Right. - What are you doing here?
I'm here helping my friend launch his new company.
"My friend." He's actually my boyfriend.
That's his booth right there.
He's got a big one-- I mean the booth.
But, um, boyfriend, uh-oh.
- Awkward. - Why?
Nothing. It's not. It's actually... it's cool.
Totally cool. Cool beans.
Beans, beans, magical fruit.
The more you eat, the more you...
- Toot? - Toot.
Hey, Joel? Come over and meet Richard.
Oh, not-- not needed.
- Not needed. - Joel, Richard.
Oh. Stairs guy.
Uh, that's quite a booth you got there.
Oh, yes, thank you. We really think
our company's message is worth getting out there.
Yeah, us too. Us too.
Um, we're just trying to be a bit responsible with the spending.
Sure, but when I sold my last company,
I realized I had the luxury to invest in something I believe in.
Helping humanity thrive.
That's why I decided to bring PeaceFare into the world.
Ah, good for you.
Okay. It was great to meet you, Richard.
Yeah, and you too.
- Good seeing you. - Not if I see you first.
Not that you asked, but you handled that very poorly.
You know, Jian-Yang,
the silence in the car gave me some time to think
about the fact that our differences-- Jesus!
Sorry.
Jian-Yang!
- Fuck you, fat fuck. - Pineapple two is a go.
Fucking look at him, pictures everywhere.
Fucking bearded baby.
Cost us millions of dollars.
It would make me very happy
to pour boiling metal down Keenan Feldspar's asshole.
How would that even work?
Flip and pour.
He's gonna run, and then you're slowly chasing him,
trying to not spill your vat of boiling metal.
- You're gonna look like a fucking idiot. - Fuck you.
- Anybody looking? - No, just go.
What's taking you so long? Hurry up!
What are you boys up to?
All right? I go through my slides. Click, click, click.
Jamiroquai plays.
Now, I would very much like to welcome my good friend,
Keenan Feldspar!
Where the fuck is he?
Son, you're supposed to be coming up from over there.
Totally, I'm just really kind of digging the vibe
over on this side.
- Uh, Terry? - Yeah?
- Kid wants to come from over here. - Okay.
Excuse me, sir, do you have a moment?
This morning, Pied Piper were
a last-minute add to the vendor list,
so I started watching them
and noticed some suspicious behavior.
I sent in for our tactical response team,
and with your permission, I'd like to sweep
the convention floor with Yagi antennas, which are--
- Hoover. - Yes, sir.
Four days ago, I spent $2 billion
on a piece-of-shit VR gadget that's never gonna work.
I had to rebuild the entire operating system
just to get a 90-second demo that could play on a phone.
And by the grace of God, I just may have pulled it off.
And now you want to talk to me about Pied fucking Piper?
Sir, I'd like to think that
if Gavin Belson were here, we'd make sure--
Gavin fucking Belson is not here
'cause I fired his ass!
Now, look, you go back to your little security room,
you sit in the corner with a tinfoil hat on,
and I swear, if I hear you wandered down the hallway
to take a piss, you are out on your ass.
You got that?
I do, sir.
You know what? This might be
a good time for me to hand out some flyers.
Richard, six Pineapples up,
six to go.
- Good. - Something wrong?
Yeah, actually. Very wrong.
PeaceFare is a game.
- What? - Yeah, look at his website.
Give virtual coins to virtual homeless people.
Grow virtual corn to feed virtual starving villages.
What the fuck, right? I mean, he's over there
making all this noise about
turning your mobile device into an empathy machine,
- but it's not doing anything. - Fascinating, Richard.
Have you heard anything about
how Pied fucking Piper is doing?
Yes, our code is in the app,
the Pineapples are online,
and we're at 3700 downloads.
We're ahead of schedule.
Shit. This could work.
That's awesome.
Yeah, exactly.
We are doing something real.
He is not, but she's with him,
and I'm the petty one. Okay, well, what about the idea
of growing real corn to feed real starving people?
- No. - Yeah,
his thing seems way easier.
Yeah, you can do it on your phone in your underwear.
Just... plant the rest of the Pineapples, please.
- Here he comes, folks. - Oh, thanks.
Richard Hendricks, the Monet of compressionism.
Jared.
Hey, which of the bathrooms is closest?
End of the row, 78 paces to the right.
Great.
Do you know this is the actual laptop I used to code the app.
Hey, let's take some without my shoes,
yeah? Perfect.
Okay. Oh, hey, come.
Yeah, so please start with my toes.
Oh, nice.
Can you-- And these are photos of irrigation,
captured in the rain.
Yeah, it's gonna look great.
Yeah, like that.
Poverty and penthos.
That looks so good.
Let's do another one. Go on the other side. Yeah.
- Did you do this? - What? What?
Did anyone see someone touch this laptop?
- What? - Oh God.
This is very disturbing.
Fuck it. I'm just gonna punch him.
Yeah, right. Have fun in jail, you moron.
- Oh shit. - Oh fuck, it's him.
- What do we do? - Uh, keep moving.
Fuck, do you think he saw us?
Oh, he saw us.
- Fuck. - He saw us see him.
Shit. Wait.
What if he thinks we did it on purpose,
like, we snubbed him?
Fuck yeah.
We just snubbed the fuck out of Keenan Feldspar.
Hey, Richard.
I'm letting everyone know.
You might want to reset your critical passwords,
because we've been hacked.
Why-- why would you say that?
Someone changed my PeaceFare screensaver...
and I know it wasn't anyone on my team,
because they all respect me too much.
What did they change it to?
If you don't mind me asking, just 'cause--
No, no, I won't dignify it by repeating it.
I'm just saying you should take precautions.
Also, Winnie spoke to security,
and they're sending the tactical response team.
The what?
The-- Oh, here they are.
Oh shit.
Bingo. We've got hostiles.
Red team, Sebastian,
fan out and sweep the entire venue.
Hey, Richard. Guess who has four thumbs
- and just snubbed Keenan Feldspar. - Us.
Guys, someone called security,
now they're doing a sweep of the area.
- What? - Okay? You've gotta go pull all the Pineapples.
- What the fuck? - Who ratted us out?
I don't know. Probably we'll never know.
It's impossible to tell.
Just go. Go get-- get them now.
Go. Just go. Please.
- Bingo. - Fuck!
Come on.
Bingo.
Oh crap. We've got to split up.
I'll take the food court. You take the east concourse.
- I want the food court. - Just go!
Fuck.
- Hey, man. - F-f-f-fucking Keenan.
Hey, I have to go.
Totally. Hey, did you snub me earlier?
- No. - Yeah, you did.
You know you did.
You made me feel bad.
I like to feel good. Why would you do that to me?
Seriously?
You fucked us, Keenan.
Richard was gonna take that deal,
and then you pulled it right out from under us.
You cost me, personally, a shit-ton of money.
Is that what Richard told you?
So?
They got every single one, every single last one.
- Fuck! - I don't want to hear this.
But we gotta be close, right?
Like, how many more phones do we need?
I don't know. Close isn't good enough.
No, this is binary. Either we have enough or we don't.
- Oh f-f-f-fuck. - Okay, I have an idea.
So, I've got one Pineapple left.
Now, I've rigged some batteries on top of it,
because we're gonna have to go mobile.
We have to try. Okay, I'm going to put this in your backpack.
- Oh no. - No, it's fine.
- I don't want it. I don't want it. - Dinesh, it's fine.
And you, you're gonna hold this kill switch,
and then you're gonna walk
into the most densely populated area you can find.
All right? If you see the security coming,
remember, you press that button and,
poof, you're gone.
Okay. I'll get as many of those motherfuckers as I can.
We'll be rewarded in the end.
When the fuck were you gonna tell us?
Tell you what?
You know what, fat sack of shit.
Richard, do you know what?
No, I don't.
I-I-- I don't know what.
Dinesh, you need to move.
Well, not until I find out if you know what.
- Go on. - Okay, fine.
I messed with Joel's screensaver,
and then he told security,
and now they're the ones pulling up all the Pineapples.
What the fuck are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
You acted like you wanted to take Keenan Feldspar's offer.
Well, I just ran into him. He said you turned him down.
Well, n-- Okay, well...
Who are you going to believe, me or him?
Him. He showed me the e-mail you sent him.
Showed you the e-mail?
You fucking snake.
Dinesh, you need to move, now. Look, he pulled the deal.
Yeah, but you didn't know
that when you sent him the e-mail, did you?
Dinesh, you need to move. I mean, come on.
- You need to go. Go. Go. - Gentlemen.
I'm going to have to see the contents of that backpack.
Bingo.
What did you change it to, Richard?
What?
Joel's screensaver.
It doesn't matter now.
No?
PoopFare.
I'm sorry. PoopFare?
Yeah, it was, like, a play on the name.
Is it a play on the name? PissFare would be way better.
Or PenisFare.
Or PeaceFart. That's just changing one letter.
Look, he-- he turned around. I had, like, a second, okay?
It's the best I could come up with.
PoopFare?
PoopFare?
- Are you serious? - Yeah.
You sacrificed...
everything that we've worked for...
for PoopFare?
How was PoopFare...
for the greater good?
It wasn't.
You compared yourself to Abraham Lincoln, Richard.
Can you do me a favor?
Can you say it so I know I'm not hallucinating?
- I just did. - Just...
say it.
- Jared. - Richard, look me in the eyes!
Look me in the eyes, and you name...
- our undoing! - Hey, come on. Calm down now.
PoopFare! You reckless child.
Gentlemen. Come with me, please.
Sit down.
Well, well, well.
Richard Hendricks.
Sorry, do I know you?
No... but I know all about you.
These Wi-Fi Pineapples... are they yours?
And this image from the security footage?
Smell anything?
These two individuals look familiar to you?
Last question.
Do you recognize this?
It's an interview I just found from Code/Rag
from October of this year,
in which you said you and Gavin Belson would, quote,
"Put Jack Barker out of a job."
Did you say that, Richard?
You know what? Yes. Yeah.
Yeah, this is me.
Because apparently everything I say or type
gets me into trouble, because I'm a... idiot.
Well now.
Tenley!
What the hell are these gentlemen doing in my office?
We caught them with Pineapples.
You mean the Pineapples
that I hired them to bring to the conference
as part of a covert penetration test of our Wi-Fi security?
- Sorry, we didn't know. - You weren't supposed to.
Now, give these gentlemen their passes and equipment back
and get them back on the floor.
You know, you said some very nice things
about Gavin Belson in that interview.
You could've very easily kicked a good man when he was down.
Good luck with whatever it is you're doing.
I'd walk you down myself,
but for reasons I really can't get into...
I'm not allowed to leave this room.
Okay.
There you are. You never came back to the booth.
You didn't want to see how it all turned out?
I wasn't really in the mood.
Are you playing PeaceFare?
Yeah. I just gave an orphan
her first calculator.
Good. Good.
But I've got something much better.
See that number?
That is the number of installs
that we've got from Hoolicon alone.
We have moved all of Melcher's data
onto a network of mobile devices.
We did it.
Do Dinesh and Gilfoyle know?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, they know.
Now that this worked, they like me again.
They're off getting churros to celebrate.
I told them that we would meet them at Barker's keynote, so...
come on.
I mean...
Richard, the fact that you think that
success justifies all your behavior--
We were in crisis mode, okay?
And yeah, I lost my head,
but crisis averted,
so it's time to reinstate habeas corpus, huh?
Be Honest Abe again.
What about the next crisis, Richard?
Jared, this won't happen again.
I swear.
So, let's just enjoy it...
for a minute.
Please.
Come on, give it up!
I love this company!
And how about you?
And how about Jamiroquai?
Ladies and gentlemen, oh, let's have it.
But wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wasn't the original title
of their chart-topping hit "Virtual Insanity"?
Why is he singing "Virtual Reality"?
You know, I may need a little help
getting to the bottom of this
from my very good friend, Keenan Feldspar!
There he is!
You guys ready to see the future?
You know, at the beginning of the presentation,
I told all of you to update your HooliPhone OS, right?
Now, I want you to go into "Settings,"
and you're gonna find a brand-new toggle
labeled "HooliVR."
You're gonna want to turn that on.
Now, look under your seats.
When you power up your HooliVR goggles,
they will "Automagically" pair with your phone.
Put 'em on
and prepare to be amazed!
Say hi to that barmaid for me.
Oh shit! Fuck!
What's going on?
Turn up the lights, please. Something's happening here.
Uh, stay calm.
You don't think this had anything to do with us, do you?
We appear to have a bit of a technical problem.
I'm going to get to the bottom of this right away.
Fuck!
Gelong-la, there is a loud man here to see you.
He says you sent for him.
Qamdo in the house!
Haircut?
Are you fucking kidding me?
No.
I'm really here.
{\an8}{\pos(94.16,212.825)}app.YYeTs.com
Oh! You only make that face when your dick is on fire.
So, you're certain?
Definitively.
The 36 HooliPhones that blew up at Hoolicon
and the 17 that blew up around the US
all had our code on them.
Richard, these are real people with real crotches,
and they're burning.
We have to tell someone. This was our fault.
No. No, no. Keenan's demo was built to run on a $10,000 rig.
Jack ported it to a phone in four days.
They wrote sloppy code that's pinging the antenna constantly,
looking for the goggles.
That had to have caused the phone's antenna to
draw too much power...
Which would overheat the subpar battery.
And when we pinged our network on top of all that...
Dick fire.
Richard, what happened to being Honest Abe from now on?
We committed a crime here.
- Barely, Jared. - The fact that we hacked those phones
works in our favor. All of our code is hidden.
Agreed. And when Hooli
launches a new software update to fix the phones,
our network will still be functional, Melcher will be happy,
Monica will fund us, and no one will ever know what we did.
- I'll know! - Yes! I'll know too, but I'm okay with it.
I'm sorry.
What the fuck is this?
I write three letters every time I start a job...
a personal action plan,
a letter to my 40-year-old self,
and that, a resignation letter.
Uh, I'll be moving my things back into my condo.
- What about your squatter? - Oh, he's been out for months.
He left to go sell cocaine at the Keystone Pipeline protests.
I've just been staying in the garage out of solidarity.
You can't leave.
- Don't beg, Richard. - I'm not.
According to the employee handbook,
which you wrote, an employee cannot leave
without giving two weeks' notice.
You-- you read the handbook?
- Yeah, I did. - All right, fine.
I'll fulfill my duties under protest,
but I will not do anything illegal nor unethical,
and I will not lie.
I already have upwards of 50 burnt perinea on my conscience.
Richard, that's enough.
Consider that my two weeks' notice.
All right. Keep an eye on HooliNews,
and let me know when Jack announces the HooliPhone update.
What do you mean you're not issuing a software update?
Who can say why the phone Gavin Belson brought to market
started exploding
when we put Keenan Feldspar's technology on it? Huh?
Is it Gavin's fault? Is it Keenan's fault?
Is it 50-50? Who knows?
We need to change the narrative here.
Has anyone flown commercial recently?
Nor have I, but apparently they're still making the announcements
at the gate about Samsung Galaxy Note 7 being banned.
We can't have people believing that our phones blow up airplanes,
no matter how much Gavin and/or Keenan may have wanted it.
It's lethal PR.
We need to get ahead of this one,
which is why I am going to pull
every last affected HooliPhone out of circulation
and replace it in the next three days.
That's over nine million devices.
Gavin Belson had to move heaven and earth to get our China plants
up to a capacity of two million per day,
and his negotiations with labor were extremely delicate.
Well, China has never negotiated with Jack Barker.
What you're proposing is staggeringly expensive
and borderline impossible.
We won't approve it.
I see. Uh...
Slight hitch. I may have instructed my comms team
to issue a press release announcing the recall...
and it should be going out at...
- Yeah, it's out. - Jack.
I'll tell you what: Let's just gas up that HooliJet,
and I am going to go ahead and go to China!
So, every fucking HooliPhone
that we're on is being pulled out of service and replaced
with a new one that doesn't have our code on it.
Half of our storage capacity just gone.
Where the fuck are we gonna put all of Melcher's data?
Wait. We have a server farm in the garage, right?
Now, don't you think if Anton could've saved our ass,
I would've suggested it by now?
- Why can't it work? - What are you, fucking stupid?
In order to hold that much data,
we would have to go RAID zero, no backup,
so if we lose even one platter,
we lose Melcher's data... permanently.
Plus, in Anton's present condition,
I'm afraid he might totally melt down.
We have to call Melcher.
No, we are not calling Melcher.
If we tell him about any of this, that would be suicide.
Look, if we're gonna die, let's just die.
Why do we have to take Anton with us?
Jesus, man. You know that thing's not alive, right?
- Fuck your dumb machine. - Wait. Do you?
Do you actually fuck your dumb machine?
- Is that the secret on your phone? - Fuck you.
- Fuck you! Do you raw-dog it? - Guys. Guys. Guys!
Or do you put a condom on your tiny penis
and fuck it in safe mode?
- Just fuck each other and get it over with. - "Oh, Anton, fuck me!"
I will fuck both of you...
- Gentlemen! This is Gladys. - Fuck you.
She's interviewing to be my replacement.
Hello.
I like your sweater.
Maybe let's talk outside.
- Great. - It's just right through here.
Gilfoyle, Anton is going to be fine, okay?
Just spin him up. Please?
All right, buddy.
Let's see what you're made of.
Outstanding.
I'm sorry that you had to witness that scene in there.
It probably gave you the impression
that the company is in disarray,
but I can assure you, there's a very simple explanation for that.
- It-- it is. - Sorry?
Yeah, even setting aside our CEO's sexual distortion,
adultery, and lowbrow scatological vandalism,
we're still essentially a-- a criminal operation
whose only real product is dangerous malware.
I see you're fluent in Japanese.
Are-- are you gonna be comfortable with casual racism?
I'm sorry. What happened here?
Uh, arson.
- Gavin. - What?
That wasn't really breakfast, was it?
Yeah.
Seriously?
What are you doing?
Well, I'm watching an episode of House.
Put that fucking thing away.
Are you afraid it's gonna blow up?
'Cause it won't. It's not a HooliPhone.
Why would a HooliPhone blow up?
We're done with the migrating!
How's it going in here?
Don't touch the fucking lights. One surge and we're dead.
- What the fuck? - What?
Oh, the eyes. They're contacts.
Okay, how we looking?
Jesus Christ!
I broke my glasses. I don't have an extra pair,
so I had to pull these out of a drawer.
I had 'em made for All Hallows' Eve.
I was a cat.
How are we looking? Did it all fit?
Yes, but Anton is overheating already.
We're about to fry three of our platters.
I said this was a bad idea.
Fuck. What are we gonna do?
Excuse me. Just FYI, Gladys turned us down.
Oh, hey, Richard, long time, no talk.
Yeah, we've all been busy, so.
- Oh yeah? - Yeah. Hey, listen, Big Head,
do you think I could get your Stanford login
so I can access the faculty server array?
Oh jeez. Uh, I don't think I can do that, man.
Sure you can, man. Just click on "Forgot password."
No, um, it-it-- it's just, um, I'm kinda on super-thin ice
with the head of the CS department right now.
After Erlich's whole SeeFood thing,
Stanford started looking into my academic background,
realized that I don't really have one,
and now I'm on probation,
and they've got this real teacher sitting in, watching me.
That is-- that is a bummer. But hey, Big Head,
they do, um, genome sequence analysis on the Sherlock cluster.
They're not gonna notice a few more measly petabytes, all right?
We'll just get on and get off
before anyone even notices we're there.
Yeah? Come on, man. I need this, all right?
I wouldn't ask you otherwise.
All right. My username is "Password"
and my password is "Password."
Your username is "Password"?
It was just easier.
Okay, Big Head came through.
I've already reserved the resources.
We can start the transfer whenever we're ready.
Slight problem. I can't get online.
What the fuck?
I can't get on either.
- Gilfoyle, did you fry the fucking router again? - No!
Jared! Did you pay the broadband bill?
No. I mean, we don't have the funds.
- What? - I tried to bring it to your attention,
but you said, "Fuck off, Mom."
Wait. Are you telling me Anton
is completely cut off from the outside world?
Which means Melcher's data is offline.
We're in breach.
Shit. Okay, uh...
you guys keep Anton alive. I will... figure something out.
A product recall on that scale?
What the fuck is Barker thinking?
Uh, I was only at eight percent,
so if you could close some applications.
Cell phone?
Lama-la, I-- I need to know what Hooli stock is doing.
Enlightenment...
or ignorance.
You must choose.
Erlich, get the bags.
Richard Hendricks. What's up?
Hi. I was just calling to let you know that, um...
we're gonna have to take the network down
just for a little bit for some routine maintenance,
so your data might be inaccessible.
- What? - Yeah. Oh, just for an hour or two.
- Nothing major. - Richard...
you're supposed to give me 72 hours' notice
for any disruption of service.
No, I know, I know, I know, but this is just to improve
your user experience, because we care.
Falling! Falling!
What the fuck are you doing?
- Would you fucking-- - Is everything okay over there?
Yeah. "Okay"? Yeah. Yeah.
Dan. Danny, Dan-Dan.
It's totally normal. Totally normal.
Look, as long as you have it back online, you know,
- before we open in the morning. - Yes, of course.
Hey, you want to talk to Liz?
- No. No, no. - I-- I'm gonna go get some cake from the back.
Why? They bring it to us.
That's okay. I'm just gonna... go to them.
All right. She's going to them.
Never get married, Richard.
Women, right?
- I'll talk to you. - Yes. Bye.
We'll go to them.
Guys, we'll go to them.
- Who? - Standford!
If we move Anton to Stanford,
we can plug him directly into the cluster,
and we'll be back online before Fiduciated opens.
It's perfect.
Yeah, except for the part
about moving Anton to fucking Stanford.
How the fuck are we gonna do that?
We take him apart, move him,
put him back together.
- That's insane. - Okay, well,
unless you happen to have a three-mile long Ethernet cable
hidden up your fucking asshole, that's the plan!
Is Big Head gonna be okay with us just showing up
with three tons of unauthorized equipment?
Yeah! I just spoke to him on the phone.
He was like, "Uh, yeah."
Okay, do it. I'll get the truck.
I'll get a truck.
You know, I flew all the way here,
to Tibet, on my own dime.
You've killed my battery.
I don't feel the slightest bit more spiritually centered.
Can this thing go any faster?
Richard. Oh. Yeah.
Okay. Thank you, Jared.
Uh, so, what--  what time did Big Head say he needed us there?
I don't know. He said whenever.
Typically, campus security requires a specific window
- for deliveries of this size. - Okay.
Did you send him an inventory,
so that he could request
and clear a static IP address for each server?
No. No. I wouldn't worry about it.
Maybe I'll just give him a call.
Nah, it's fine. It's fine. It'll be fine.
- Well, maybe I'll just text him. - Jared! Oh my God!
Just-- just stop with the second-guessing, hand-wringing,
pearl-clutching bullshit, okay, for just, like, a fucking minute.
You know what? Um, I waive your two weeks.
- You can go. - What?
You wanted to go? Go.
Bye. Thanks.
I'll order a Lyft home and...
What the fuck was that? You fired him?
He already quit, remember?
Besides, he was being a fucking asshole.
Jared was being an asshole?
Do you want to go with him?
Because, if you haven't noticed,
if we don't get this shit to Standford
and all set up by 9:00 a.m.,
we are fucked!
Okay, listen up, everybody, here's the deal.
I was just talking to your foreman, Jung-Sho...
...and he seems to feel
that you are all working at maximum capacity
and that you cannot work any harder.
But I have just flown from America,
and I'm here to prove to you that he is wrong.
You can work harder, much harder.
How? With a little system I like to call
the conjoined triangles of success!
Come on.
Breaking news.
Hooli CEO Jack Barker has been taken hostage by workers
at a Hooli factory in China,
which produces cell phones.
I want everyone to know I haven't been harmed...
and the workers here have assured me
that I will only be held as their honored guest
until Hooli has met their very reasonable request
for fair wages and for humane conditions.
- On a more personal note,
- honey--
- I have to stop now.
All right.
Holy shit. I think we can actually make it.
All right.
What the fuck?
Shit. We must've left the work lights on all night.
Well, do we have jumper cables?
- Jared did. - Triple-A?
- Sounds like a Jared thing. - Wait.
Aren't Anton's racks full of backup batteries?
Okay. How much longer?
Give us a minute. We just need to connect a few more.
Try it now.
Just fuck the batteries! We don't need 'em! Let's go!
- Okay, hold on. - Oh my God, just throw them away!
Okay, dude. Go, go.
Oh Jesus! Shit.
Oh, hey, Ashley. That was close.
Well, look, it won't be the last time you stop traffic, huh?
Little hottie.
But not now, when you're older.
I'm sorry, we have to-- We have to go. Bye.
Back up, back up. Thank you.
Big Head. Hey, I need you to meet me at the loading dock
behind Spilker in 10 minutes. I'll explain there.
Now's not really a great time, Richard.
I'm sort of in the middle of something.
Wait. You said you already explained.
Yeah, I know. I did. Yeah, it's just... Big Head.
Come on, buddy, I need you.
Okay. Be right there.
Can I go to the bathroom?
Are you sure? We don't want to inconvenience you.
It's no trouble at all, and there's no need to send a negotiator.
I'm in Tibet. It's right next door.
Well, we'd be grateful to have this in such good hands.
We've missed you, Gavin.
Perhaps when you return, we--
Please. The only thing I'm concerned with right now
is bringing our boy home safe.
Fuck you, Jack Barker!
Opium? Are you fucking kidding me?
I was on the phone for, like, three minutes.
Big... Head.
Come on, get up.
We need to get to the airstrip.
Shit. Shit. Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Start unloading it. Come on.
Hey, man, so did you ever transfer all that data?
No, we just gotta unload our servers near the Sherlock arrays.
Servers? Richard, man, I told you,
now is not a good time for this.
- I know, I know, I know. - You dick.
You never told Big Head
we were bringing Anton here, did you?
Who's Anton?
He's everything that's packed into the back
of this giant fucking truck.
And you want to set it all up here?
Oh, dude, come on.
I told you I'm, like, so close to getting fired.
Big Head, come on. It's just for a bit.
Richard, you specifically told us
that Big Head said this was okay.
That's what you fucking told us!
You lied to our faces again.
Come on, guys, we don't have time for this.
You were just going to show up and fucking steamroll him?
That was your whole plan? He's your oldest friend,
and you're okay just getting him fired?
He's Big Head!
He's gonna fall ass-backward into something, you know?
- He always does. - I'm not doing it.
- What? - I'm out too.
Now? We're-we're-we're-- we're so--
We-- we got it. We're here. W-we did it.
You... hypocrites.
You fucking hypocrites.
When I wouldn't use the fake users, you called me a pussy.
When I wouldn't lie on the stand,
you called me a pussy.
But now, when I'm actually doing
what you've been wanting me to do, you quit?
You're the pussies. You are the pussies.
I'm the only one that's trying to fucking...
save what we do here!
All this time we spent building this thing, and now,
now it falls apart because you two don't fucking do it?
This is too much for you? Well, fuck you!
Hey, guys?
This is fine.
- What? - Yeah, my bad.
I thought you were talking about a lot more stuff.
Gre...
Fuck.
...fuck.
So, anyways, my office is unlocked
if you guys just wanna, like, toss that on my desk or whatever.
I should probably get back, though,
before that teacher guy gets me in trouble.
I'll see you guys.
How?
Who?
You had me open up the back... to get the batteries,
and then you told me not to put them back,
so... no one...
You know who would've remembered to close the door?
Jared.
It's Melcher.
Good luck with that.
Richard.
Can I come in?
I have company.
Is there a girl in there?
How many girls are in there?
- Richard, what do you want from me? - Nothing, it's just...
you were right about all of it.
I killed Anton,
and, uh, I lost all of Melcher's data,
everybody fucking hates me,
and I'm basically one blood boy away from being Gavin Belson.
I did not...
run the company with integrity...
but...
I'm gonna end it with some.
I'm going to Melcher's office, and I'm coming clean.
Anyway...
I'm really fucking sorry, man.
Well, I'll leave you alone now.
Hey. "This guy fucks."
Richard!
- What's this? - It's a job application.
I'd like to submit myself for a position with Pied Piper.
I'd really like to be there till the bitter end.
"Lordy, Lordy, looks who's 40."
That's the wrong one.
I gotta say, Gavin...
when that storeroom door opened,
and I saw your face grinning down at me,
I thought it was an angel.
When we get home, I'm going to do everything in my power
to get you back in the good graces of the Hooli board.
I can use a fellow of your talents, sir.
That's very gracious of you, Jack. Thank you.
Welcome aboard, gentlemen.
Our flying time to Mountain View is 11 hours and 36 minutes,
and we will be stopping off in Jackson Hole first.
Stopping off at Jackson Hole, are you, Gavin?
No, Jack. You are.
Jackson Hole is definitively out of the way.
Everyone knows that.
But I don't mind dropping you off first,
this one last time.
What are you guys doing here?
Jared called us.
If you're gonna eat a giant plate of steaming hot shit,
we figured it should probably be a team effort.
Okay. Thanks.
I'll go check in.
Hi, could you tell Dan Melcher that Richard Hendricks
and the guys from Pied Piper are here to see him?
You guys are Pied Piper?
The guys who built our data storage network? It's awesome.
Yeah, it was awesome until it crashed this morning.
I was just using it two minutes ago. It's working fine.
- Really? - Yeah.
What's he talking about?
It's up.
All of Melcher's data is there.
How is that possible?
What are those devices? Those aren't phones.
Why the fuck are you laughing?
You look fucking insane right now.
Look at that OUI prefixes in these MAC addresses.
Yeah, okay, so what are those?
Smart fridges.
About 30,000 of them.
Come again?
Jian-Yang's smart fridge must have been self-correcting.
In order to fit my "Suck it, Jian-Yang" Video onto his fridge,
I had to add Pied Piper libraries to the firmware.
Other smart fridges must've seen this as an update.
- What? - The smart fridges talk to each other,
and they share the new software.
Right, so when we put that data onto Anton,
the last thing he did before he died
was back himself up onto a huge network of smart fridges.
Anton died so we could live.
Like Jesus.
Oh fuck.
Guys, do you realize what just happened?
We're still alive. The network is stable.
The new Internet works, and this is the proof.
- We did it! - Yes, we did.
Wait a minute.
If Melcher never lost access to his data,
what's he so upset about?
Richard! Richard! I'm so sorry.
We were tasting cakes, and then you called,
- and then it just... came out. - What came out?
- You son of a bitch! - Save yourself!
I'm guessing there's a story here.
- Stand down! No, no, no! - That's it! Help!
Gavin.
I like your hair.
I like your eye.
Yeah, I-- I got it from a woman.
She didn't hit me. No, the man did...
because of sex... that I gave to her.
So... welcome home,
and congratulations on getting your business back.
Thank you. And I should congratulate you
on your remarkable tech breakthrough.
I hear you're swimming in funding offers.
A few. I think we're gonna go with Bream-Hall.
They seem to get us.
You haven't seen all the offers yet.
Richard, we were partners once.
I'd like to do it again.
This is an acquisition offer,
and it will make you a very wealthy man.
Let's do this together.
That's very kind of you.
- But-- - Richard, at least look it over.
I can help you get exactly where you want to go.
I'm pretty sure I know where I want to go and how to get there.
If you reject me now, Richard,
I will come after you. I'll devour you.
Think very carefully about what you're doing here.
Here's what I think, Gavin.
I think my decentralized Internet
threatens Hooli's box business model.
I think, basically, you are just a server company now,
and we intend to make servers obsolete.
So, I think perhaps in the end,
I will be the one devouring you.
I gave you that patent.
Thanks.
Fair enough, Richard.
I shall look forward to the fight.
Right back at you, Gavy, baby.
Gavin.
Hid Erlich ever show up in Tibet?
No.
Jesus. What the hell did he order?
No. No. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop it. Stop it.
No. Don't.
